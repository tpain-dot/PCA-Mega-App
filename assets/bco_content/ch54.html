<h2>CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR</h2>
<h4 class="p1"><i>The Worship of God by Offerings</i><i></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>54-1</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The Holy Scriptures teach that God is the owner of all persons and all things and that we are but stewards of both life and possessions; that God’s ownership and our stewardship should be acknowledged; that this acknowledgement should take the form, in part, of giving at least a tithe of our income and other offerings to the work of the Lord through the Church of Jesus Christ, thus worshipping the Lord with our possessions; and that the remainder should be used as becomes Christians.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>54-2</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>It is both a privilege and a duty, plainly enjoined in the Bible, to make regular, weekly, systematic and proportionate offerings for the support of religion and for the propagation of the Gospel in our own and foreign lands, and for the relief of the poor. This should be done as an exercise of grace and an act of worship, and at such time during the service as may be deemed expedient by the Session.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>54-3</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>It is appropriate that the offerings be dedicated by prayer.</p>
