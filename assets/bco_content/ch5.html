<h4 class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><i>The Organization of a Particular Church</i></h4>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><b>A. Mission Churches</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b></p>
<p class="p3"><b>5-1.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>A mission church may be properly described in the same manner as the particular church is described in <i>BCO</i> 4-1. It is distinguished from a particular church in that it has no permanent governing body, and thus must be governed or supervised by others. However, its goal is to mature and be organized as a particular church as soon as this can be done decently and in good order.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p4"><b>5-2.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span></b>Ordinarily, mission churches are established by Presbyteries within their boundaries.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p4">a.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Initiatives to which the Presbytery may respond in establishing a mission church include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;">i.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The Presbytery establishes a mission church at its own initiative.</p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;">ii.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The Presbytery responds to the initiative of a Session of a particular church.</p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;">iii.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The Presbytery responds to the petition of an independent gathering of believers who have expressed their desire to become a congregation by submitting to the Presbytery a written request.</p>
<p class="p4">b.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>In the event an existing non-PCA church is interested in coming into the PCA, the Presbytery shall work with the church leadership to determine whether the church should come into the PCA as a mission church or seek Presbytery approval to be received under the provisions of <i>BCO </i>13-8.</p>
<p class="p4">c.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Should it become necessary, the Presbytery may dissolve the mission church. Church members enrolled should be cared for according to the procedures of 13-10.</p>
<p class="p4">d.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>If the mission church is located outside the bounds of a Presbytery, the responsibility may be exercised through the General Assembly’s Committee on Mission to North America or Committee on Mission to the World, as the case may be, according to the <i>Rules of Assembly Operations</i>. In such a case the powers of the Presbytery in the following provisions shall be exercised by the General Assembly through its appropriate committee.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p3"><b>5-3.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span></b>The mission church, because of its transitional condition, requires a temporary system of government. Depending on the circumstances and at its own discretion, Presbytery may provide for such government in one of several ways:</p>
<p class="p8">a.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Appoint an evangelist as prescribed in <i>BCO </i>8-6.</p>
<p class="p4">b.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Cooperate with the Session of a particular church in arranging a mother-daughter relationship with a mission church. The Session may then serve as the temporary governing body of the mission church.</p>
<p class="p4">c.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Appoint a <i>BCO</i><b><i> </i></b>15-1 commission to serve as a temporary Session of the mission church. When a minister of the Presbytery has been approved to serve as pastor of the mission church, he shall be included as a member of the commission and serve as its moderator.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p3">The temporary system of government shall record and submit its records to Presbytery for annual review in the same manner as Sessions of particular churches.</p>
<p class="p9">
<p class="p8"><b>5-4.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Pastoral ministry for the mission church may be provided:</p>
<p class="p4">a.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>by a minister of the Presbytery called by Presbytery to serve as pastor, or</p>
<p class="p4">b.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>by stated, student, or ruling elder supply (<i>BCO</i> 22-5, -6), or</p>
<p class="p4">c.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>by a series of qualified preachers approved by the temporary government (<i>BCO</i> 12-5.e).</p>
<p class="p9">
<p class="p3"><b>5-5.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The temporary government shall receive members (<i>BCO</i> 12-5.a) into the mission church according to the provisions of <i>BCO</i> 57 so far as they may be applicable. As members of the mission church those received are communing or non-communing members of the Presbyterian Church in America.</p>
<p class="p4">a.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>If there is a minister approved by Presbytery to serve the mission church as its pastor (<i>BCO</i> 5-4.a), each member so received shall be understood to assent to the call of that minister and to affirm the promises made to the pastor in <i>BCO</i> 21-10.</p>
<p class="p4">b.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Meetings of the members of the mission church shall be governed according to the provisions of <i>BCO</i> 25 so far as they may be applicable.</p>
<p class="p9">
<p class="p3"><b>5-6.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Mission churches and their members shall have the right of judicial process to the court having oversight of their temporary governing body. </p>
<p class="p9">
<p class="p3"><b>5-7.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Mission churches shall maintain a roll of communicant and non-communicant members, in the same manner as, but separate from, other particular churches.</p>
<p class="p9">
<p class="p3"><b>5-8.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>It is the intention of the Presbyterian Church in America that mission churches enjoy the same status as particular churches in relation to civil government.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><b></b></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><b>B. The Organization of a Particular Church</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b></p>
<p class="p3"><b>5-9.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span></b>A new church can be organized only by the authority of Presbytery.</p>
<p class="p4">a.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>A Presbytery should establish standing rules setting forth the prerequisites that qualify a mission church to begin the organization process, e.g., the minimum number of petitioners and the level of financial support to be provided by the congregation. The number of officers sufficient to constitute the quorum for a session shall be necessary to complete the organization process.</p>
<p class="p4">b.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The temporary government of the mission church shall oversee the steps necessary for organization.</p>
<p class="p4">c.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>When the temporary government determines that among the members of the mission congregation there are men who appear qualified as officers, the nomination process shall begin and the election conclude following the procedures of <i>BCO</i> 24 so far as they may be applicable.</p>
<p class="p4">d.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The election of officers shall normally take place at least two weeks prior to the date of the organization service. However, the effective date of service for the newly elected officers shall be upon the completion of the organization service.</p>
<p class="p4">e.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>If deacons are not elected, the duties of the office shall devolve upon the Session, until deacons can be secured.</p>
<p class="p4">f.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>If there is a minister approved by Presbytery to serve the mission church as its pastor, and members of the mission church have been received according to <i>BCO</i> 5-5, the temporary session shall call a congregational meeting at which the congregation may, by majority vote, call the organizing pastor to be their pastor without the steps of <i>BCO </i>20. If no such minister has been appointed, or the minister or congregation choose not to continue the pastoral relationship of the newly organized church, a pastor shall be called as follows:</p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;">(1)<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The temporary government shall oversee the election of a pastor according the provisions of <i>BCO</i> 20 so far as they are applicable. If a candidate is to be proposed before the organization, the congregational meeting to elect a pastor shall take place early enough for Presbytery to consider and approve the pastor’s call prior to the service of organization. This may be the same meeting called for the election of other officers.</p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;">(2)<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The ordination and/or installation shall be according to the provisions of <i>BCO</i> 21 so far as they are applicable. The service may take place at the service of organization.</p>
<p class="p4">g.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>In order to proceed to organization as a particular church the members of the mission church shall sign a petition to Presbytery requesting the same.</p>
<p class="p4">h.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Upon Presbytery’s approval of the petition, Presbytery shall appoint an organizing commission and shall set the date and time of the organization service.</p>
<p class="p4">i.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><span class="s1">At the service of organization the following elements shall be included</span> in the order deemed by the organizing commission to be appropriate:</p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;">(1)<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The organizing commission shall ordain and/or install ruling elders and/or deacons according to the provisions of <i>BCO</i> 24-6 so far as they may be applicable.</p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;">(2)<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>If a pastor is being ordained and/or installed at the service, the organizing commission shall act according to the provisions of <i>BCO</i> 21 so far as they may be applicable.</p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;">(3)<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>A member of the organizing commission shall require communicant members of the mission church present to enter <span class="s2">into covenant, by answering the following question affirmatively,</span> with uplifted hand:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;">
<p class="p10" style="padding-left: 120px;"><b>Do you, in reliance on God for strength, solemnly promise and covenant that you will walk together as a particular church, on the principles of the faith and order of the Presbyterian Church in </b><span class="s3"><b>America, and that you will be zealous and faithful in</b></span><b> </b><span class="s3"><b>maintaining the purity and peace of the whole body?</b></span></p>
<p class="p11" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s2"><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 40px;">(4)<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>A member of the organizing commission shall then say:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;">
<p class="p10" style="padding-left: 120px;"><b>I now pronounce and declare that you are constituted a church according to the Word of God and the faith and order of the Presbyterian Church in America. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. </b></p>
<p class="p13" style="padding-left: 120px;"><b></b></p>
<p class="p3"><b>5-10.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Upon organization, the newly elected Session should meet as soon as is practicable to elect a stated clerk and formulate a budget. If there is no pastor, the Session may elect as moderator one of their own number or any teaching elder of the Presbytery with Presbytery’s approval. Further, if there is no pastor, action shall be taken to secure, as soon as practicable, the regular administration of Word and Sacraments.</p>
