<h2>CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO</h2>
<h4 class="p1"><i>Public Prayer</i><i></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>52-1</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>It is proper to begin the public worship in the sanctuary with the Doxology followed by a short prayer, in which the minister shall lead the people, humbly adoring the infinite majesty of the living God, expressing a sense of our distance from Him as creatures, and our unworthiness as sinners; and humbly imploring His gracious presence, the assistance of His Holy Spirit in the duties of His worship, and His acceptance of us through the merits of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. It is appropriate that this prayer conclude with the Lord’s Prayer in which all may unite.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>52-2</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Then, after singing a psalm, or hymn, it is proper that, before the sermon, there should be a full and comprehensive prayer: </p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;">a.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Adoring the glory and perfections of God, as they are made known to us in the works of creation, in the conduct of Providence, and in the clear and full revelation He has made of Himself in His written words;</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;">b.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Giving thanks to Him for all His mercies of every kind, general and particular, spiritual and temporal, common and special; above all, for Christ Jesus, His unspeakable gift, the hope of eternal life through Him, and for the mission and work of the Holy Spirit;</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;">c.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Making humble confession of sin, both original and actual, acknowledging, and endeavoring to lead the heart of every worshipper with a deep sense of the evil of all sin, as such, as being a departure from the living God; and also taking a particular and affecting view of the various fruits which proceed from this root of bitterness; as sins against God, our neighbor and ourselves; sins in thought, in word, and in deed; sins secret and presumptuous; sins accidental and habitual. Also, the aggravations of sin, arising from knowledge, or the means of it; from distinguishing mercies; from valuable privileges; from breach of vows, etc.;</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;">d.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Making earnest supplication for the pardon of sin, and peace with God, through the blood of the atonement, with all its important and happy fruits; for the Spirit of sanctification, and abundant supplies of the grace that is necessary to the discharge of our duty; for support and comfort, under all the trials to which we are liable, as we are sinful and mortal; and for all temporal mercies that may be necessary in our passage through this valley of tears; always remembering to view them as flowing in the channel of covenant love, and intended to be subservient to the preservation and progress of the spiritual life;</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;">e.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Pleading from every principle warranted in Scripture; from our own necessity; the all-sufficiency of God; the merit and intercession of our Saviour; and the glory of God in the comfort and happiness of His people;</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;">f.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Intercession and petition for others, including the whole world for mankind; for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon all flesh; for the peace, purity, and extension of the Church of God; for ministers and missionaries in all lands; for all who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake; for the particular church then assembled, and all other churches associated in one body with it; for the sick, dying, and bereaved; for the poor and destitute; for strangers, for prisoners, the aged and the young; for those who travel; for the community in which the church is situated; for civil rulers; and for whatever else may seem to be necessary or suitable to the occasion. </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The prominence given each of these topics must be left to the discretion of the minister.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>52-3</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Ordinarily there should be prayer after the sermon having relation to the subject that has been treated in the discourse; and all other public prayers should be appropriate to the occasion.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>52-4</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Ministers are not to be confined to fixed forms of prayer for public worship, yet it is the duty of the minister, previous to entering upon his office, to prepare and qualify himself for this part of his work, as well as for preaching. He should, by a thorough acquaintance with the Holy Scriptures, by the study of the best writers on prayer, by meditation, and by a life of communion with God, endeavor to acquire both the spirit and the gift of prayer. Moreover, when he is to offer prayer in public worship, he should compose his spirit, and so order his thoughts, that he may perform this duty with dignity and propriety, and with profit to the worshippers, lest he disgrace this important service by coarse, undignified, careless, irregular or extravagant expressions.</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>52-5.</strong> All prayer is to be offered in the language of the people.</span></p>
