<h4 class="p3"><em>A CHILD’S FUNERAL</em></h4>
<p class="p5">Let the service begin with the reading of the whole or a part of the following selections from Scripture:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1"><b>May the Lord answer you in the day of trouble; may the name of the God of Jacob defend you; may He send you help from the sanctuary, and strengthen you out of Zion (Psalm 20:1-1).</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1"><b>Man who is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. He comes forth like a flower, and fades away; he flees like a shadow and does not continue (Job 14:1).</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1"><b>The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord (Job 1:21).</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1"><b>Come unto me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest (Matthew 11:28).</b></span></p>
<p class="p5">Prayer:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s6"><b>Father of mercies, God of all grace, ever comforting us by the tender assurance of Your love for all those whom you chasten, be near to us now in this hour of sorrow, as we come to cast our care upon You, and seek the strength and consolation You only can impart.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s6"><b>As a father pities His children, so do You pity those who sit before You, smitten and afflicted. As one whom his mother comforts, do You comfort them, and so sanctify to them this sorrow that theirs may be everlasting consolation.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s6"><b>O You who leads Joseph like a flock, who knows Your own sheep by name as they follow You, carrying the lambs in Your arms and folding them in Your bosom, it is not Your will that one of these little ones should perish. When You do send your messenger, like a gentle shepherd, to lead them into the heavenly pastures, may bereaved parents hear the voice which says, “Let the little children come to Me and do not forbid them” (Matthew 19:14). Fill them with resignation to Your will; give them the consolations of Your Spirit, and grant that, through Your grace, this chastening may be for their profit, that, being made partakers of Your holiness, they may be prepared for everlasting blessedness in that world where, after the separations and sorrows of this life, they may be forever with one another and with the Lord, through the merits and mediation of Jesus Christ, Your Son, our Savior. Amen.</b></span></p>
<p class="p5">Hymn.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s5">The minister may read the whole or a part of the following selections:</span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s6"><b>Psalm 23:</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s6"><b>The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me to lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside the still waters. He restores my soul; He leads me in the paths of righteousness for His name’s sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; my cup runs over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s6"><b>2 Samuel 12:16-23:</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s6"><b>David therefore pleaded with God for the child, and David fasted and went in and lay all night on the ground. So the elders of his house arose and went to him, to raise him up from the ground. But he would not, nor did he eat food with them. Then on the seventh day it came to pass that the child died. And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead. For they said, “Indeed, while the child was still alive, we spoke to him, and he would not heed our voice. How can we tell him that the child is dead? He may do some harm!” When David saw that his servants were whispering, David perceived that the child was dead. Therefore David said to his servants, “Is the child dead?” And they said, “He is dead.” So David arose from the ground, washed and anointed himself, and changed his clothes; and he went into the house of the Lord and worshiped. Then he went to his own house; and when he requested, they set food before him, and he ate. Then his servants said to him, “What is this that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive, but when the child died, you arose and ate food?” So he said, “While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, ‘Who can tell whether the Lord will be gracious to me, that the child may live?’ “But now he is dead; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.”</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s6"><b>Isaiah 51:12, 66:13:</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s6"><b>I, even I, am He who comforts you. . . .As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s6"><b>John 13:7:</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s6"><b>What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will know after this.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s6"><b>Hebrews 12:5-7, 11-12:</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s6"><b>My son, do not despise the chastening of the Lord, nor be discouraged when you are rebuked by Him; for whom the Lord loves He chastens, and scourges every son whom He receives. If you endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom a father does not chasten? . . . Now no chastening seems to be joyful for the present, but grievous; nevertheless, afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it. Therefore strengthen the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s6"><b>Romans 8:15-18:</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s6"><b>For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father.” The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs&#8211;heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified together. For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s6"><b>John 14:1-2:</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s6"><b>Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me. In My Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you may be also.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s6"><b>Isaiah 40:1, 11:</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s6"><b>Comfort, comfort My people, says your God. . . .He shall feed his flock like a shepherd; He shall gather the lambs with His arm, and carry them in His bosom.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s6"><b>Mark 10:13-16:</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s6"><b>Then they brought young children to Him, that He might touch them; but the disciples rebuked those who brought them. But when Jesus saw it, He was greatly displeased and said to them, “Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of God. Assuredly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it.” And He took them up in His arms, put His hands on them, and blessed them.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s7"><b>Matthew 18:10-14:</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s7"><b>Take heed that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that in heaven their angels always see the face of My Father who is in heaven. For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost. What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine and go to the mountains to seek the one that is straying? And if he should find it, assuredly, I say to you, he rejoices more over that sheep than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray. Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s7"><b>Revelation 7:15-17:</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s7"><b>Therefore they are before the throne of God, and serve Him day and night in His temple. And He who sits on the throne will dwell among them. They shall neither hunger anymore nor thirst anymore; the sun shall not strike them, nor any heat; for the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them and lead them to living fountains of waters. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s7">Prayer:</span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s7"><b>O God, our heavenly Father, who through the blood of Your Son has provided redemption for all Your own, we would render to You most hearty thanks, in this our time of grief, for the sure confidence we have that the soul of this dear child whose loss we mourn is at rest in You. Not a sparrow falls to the ground without our Father, and those who are of more value than many sparrows cannot die until You, who regards with tender compassion the weakest of Your creatures, call them to Yourself. We would not sorrow as those who have no hope, but bow in humble submission to Your sovereign decree, and by divine grace would say, Your will be done.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s7"><b>Vouchsafe unto Your servants, we beseech You, the consolations of Your Spirit, giving us beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness. May this chastisement which now seems so grievous yield us the peaceable fruits of righteousness, by drawing us into closer fellowship with You, that we may not set our affections on the things of this world; but upon that blessed home above, where all who have departed in Christ await us beyond the reach of sorrow.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s7"><b>Shine upon our darkness, O Lord; pardon all our sins; build us up and strengthen us in our most holy faith; and at last give us the victory over death, bringing us in holiness and joy to Your own eternal rest.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Hear now our prayer, O God, and be pleased mercifully to bestow the blessings which we need, for the love of Jesus Christ, Your well-beloved Son, to whom, with You and the Holy Spirit, be all dominion, glory and praise, world without end. Amen.</b></p>
<p class="p5">Lord’s Prayer:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Our Father in heaven, Hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.</b></p>
<p class="p5">Benediction:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all. Amen.</b></p>
