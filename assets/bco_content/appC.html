<h2 class="p3">APPENDIX C</h2>
<h4 class="p3"><em>A FUNERAL SERVICE</em><b></b><b></b></h4>
<p class="p5">Let the service begin with the reading of the whole or a part of the following selections from Scripture:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>I am the resurrection and the life; He who believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live. And whoever lives and believes in Me, shall never die (John 11:25-26).</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Man who is born of woman is of few days, and full of trouble. He comes forth like a flower, and fades away; he flees like a shadow, and does not continue (Job 14:1-2).</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>For we are aliens and pilgrims before You, as were all our fathers; our days on the earth are as a shadow, and without hope (1 Chronicles 29:15).</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>We brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out (1 Timothy 6:7).</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away: blessed be the name of the Lord (Job 1:21).</b></p>
<p class="p5">Prayer of Invocation:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>O God, You who are our God, and our fathers’ God; You whose compassions fail not, but who are the same yesterday, today, and forever, grant us now your presence, we beseech you, that our souls may be strengthened, and that we faint not under your afflicting providence, but that through your condescension we may find all grace to help in this our time of need, which we ask in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, to whom, with You and the Holy Ghost, we will ascribe all honor, majesty and might, world without end. Amen.</b></p>
<p class="p5">Hymn.</p>
<p class="p5">Then let the whole or a part of the following selections of Scripture be read:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>Psalm 39:4-13:</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>Lord, make me to know my end, and what is the measure of my days, that I may know how frail I am.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>Indeed, You have made my days as handbreadths, and my age is as nothing before You; certainly every man at his best state is but vapor. Selah.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>Surely every man walks about like a shadow; surely they busy themselves in vain; he heaps up riches, and does not know who will gather them.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>And now, Lord, what do I wait for? My hope is in You.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>Deliver me from all my transgressions; do not make me the reproach of the foolish.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>I was mute, I did not open my mouth, because it was You who did it.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>Remove Your plague from me; I am consumed by the blow of Your hand.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>When with rebukes You correct man for iniquity, You make his beauty melt away like a moth; surely every man is vapor. Selah</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>Hear my prayer, O Lord, and give ear to my cry; do not be silent at my tears; for I am a stranger with You, a sojourner, as all my fathers were.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>Remove Your gaze from me, that I may regain strength, before I go away and am no more.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>Psalm 90:1-12:</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>Lord, You have been our dwelling place in all generations.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever You had formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>You turn man to destruction, and say, “Return, O children of men.”</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>For a thousand years in Your sight are like yesterday when it is past, and like a watch in the night.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>You carry them away like a flood; they are like a sleep. In the morning they are like grass which grows up:</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>In the morning it flourishes and grows up; in the evening it is cut down and withers.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>For we have been consumed by Your anger, and by Your wrath we are terrified.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>You have set our iniquities before You, our secret sins in the light of Your countenance.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>For all our days have passed away in Your wrath; we finish our years like a sigh.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>The days of our lives are seventy years; and if by reason of strength they are eighty years, yet their boast is only labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Who knows the power of Your anger? For as the fear of You, so is Your wrath.</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>So teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>1 Corinthians 15:20-58:</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>But now Christ is risen from the dead, and has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. For since by man came death, by Man also came the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive. But each one in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, afterward those who are Christ’s at His coming. Then comes the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God the Father, when He puts an end to all rule and all authority and power. For He must reign till He has put all enemies under His feet. The last enemy that will be destroyed is death. For “He has put all things under His feet.” But when He says “all things are put under Him,” it is evident that He who put all things under Him is excepted. Now when all things are made subject to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subject to Him who put all things under Him, that God may be all in all.</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Otherwise, what will they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead do not rise at all? Why then are they baptized for the dead? And why do we stand in jeopardy every hour? I affirm, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily. If, in the manner of men, I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantage is it to me? If the dead do not rise, “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.” Do not be deceived: “Evil company corrupts good habits.” Awake to righteousness, and do not sin; for some do not have the knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame. </b><span class="s6"><b>But someone will say, “How are the dead raised up? And with what body do they come?” Foolish one, what you sow is not made alive unless it dies. And what you sow, you do not sow that body that shall be, but mere grain &#8212; perhaps wheat or some other grain. But God gives it a body as He pleases, and to each seed its own body. All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fish, and another of birds. There are also celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another. There is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory. So also is the resurrection of the dead. The body is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption. It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. And so it is written, “The first man Adam became a living being.” The last Adam became a life-giving spirit. However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural, and afterward the spiritual. The first man was of the earth, made of dust; the second Man is the Lord from heaven. As was the man of dust, so also are those who are made of dust; and as is the heavenly Man, so also are those who are heavenly. And as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly Man. Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor does corruption inherit incorruption.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s6"><b>Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed &#8212; in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written: “Death is swallowed up in victory.”</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s6"><b>“O Death, where is your sting? O Hades, where is your victory?”</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s6"><b>The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.</b></span></p>
<p class="p5">Instead of the foregoing passage from 1 Corinthians 15, one or more of the following may be substituted as the occasion may require:</p>
<p class="p20" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>Ecclesiastes 12:1-7:</b></span></p>
<p class="p20" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>Remember now your Creator in the days of your youth, before the difficult days come, and the years draw near when you say, “I have no pleasure in them”: While the sun and the light, the moon and the stars, are not darkened, and the clouds do not return after the rain; in the day when the keepers of the house tremble, and the strong men bow down; when the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look through the windows grow dim; when the doors are shut in the streets, and the sound of grinding is low; when one rises up at the sound of a bird, and all the daughters of music are brought low; also when they are afraid of height, and of terrors in the way; when the almond tree blossoms, the grasshopper is a burden, and desire fails. For man goes to his eternal home, and the mourners go about the streets.</b></span></p>
<p class="p20" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>Remember your Creator before the silver cord is loosed, or the golden bowl is broken, or the pitcher shattered at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the well. Then the dust will return to the earth as it was, and the spirit will return to God who gave it.</b></span></p>
<p class="p20" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>Psalm 27:</b></span></p>
<p class="p20" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? When the wicked came against me to eat up my flesh, my enemies and foes, they stumbled and fell. Though an army should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though war should rise against me, in this I will be confident.</b></span></p>
<p class="p20" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>One thing I have desired of the Lord, that will I seek: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in His temple. For in the time of trouble He shall hide me in His pavilion; in the secret place of His tabernacle He shall hide me; He shall set me high upon a rock.</b></span></p>
<p class="p20" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies all around me; therefore I will offer sacrifices of joy in His tabernacle; I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to the Lord.</b></span></p>
<p class="p20" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice! Have mercy also upon me, and answer me. When You said, “Seek My face,” my heart said to You, “Your face, Lord, I will seek.” Do not hide Your face from me; do not turn Your servant away in anger; You have been my help; do not leave me nor forsake me, O God of my salvation. When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take care of me.</b></span></p>
<p class="p20" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>Teach me Your way, O Lord, and lead me in a smooth path, because of my enemies. Do not deliver me to the will of my adversaries; for false witnesses have risen against me, and such as breathe out violence. I would have lost heart, unless I had believed that I would see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. Wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart; wait, I say, on the Lord!</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>Revelation 22:1-5:</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding from the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the middle of its street, and on either side of the river, was the tree of life, which bore twelve fruits, each tree yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. And there shall be no more curse, but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and His servants shall serve Him. They shall see His face, and His name shall be on their foreheads. And there shall be no night there: they need no lamp nor light of the sun, for the Lord God gives them light. And they shall reign forever and ever.</b></span></p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5">Prayer:</span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>Almighty and most merciful God, our heavenly Father, the consolation of the sorrowful and the support of the stricken, who does not willingly afflict the children of men, look in pity, we beseech you, on all upon whom You have laid your afflicting hand, and, in the multitude of Your tender mercies, be pleased to uphold and comfort them in the day of their trial and distress. Grant us all grace that we may lay to heart the lesson of this solemn providence, and work while the day lasts, knowing that the night comes, when no man can work; and that we may set our affections on things that are in heaven, and not on things that are on the earth. Enable us to live by faith in the Son of God, that when Christ, who is our life, shall appear, we also may appear with Him in glory.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>O Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world, to whom shall we go but to You? You have the words of eternal life. You who were a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief, have pity upon those who cry unto You. When our eyes grow dim in the shadows of death, and we pass through the deep waters, by Your agony and bloody sweat, and by Your death on Calvary, we beseech You to remember us. O You who have saved us forsake us not in the trying hour; You who has vanquished death, give us the victory, and bring us to Your own everlasting rest in the assembly of Your saints on high.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>O God, the Holy Ghost, author of light and life and truth, inspire our souls with hope through the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, imparting the benefits of His atonement, and the power of His all-sufficient grace. Release us from our sins; fill us with the fruits of Your own indwelling, and form us anew in the image of God. Help us now, O blessed Comforter; heal our wounded spirits and do not despise our broken and contrite hearts.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>O God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, Triune Jehovah, have mercy upon us, Your servants, as we wait before You: and hear our prayer. Be pleased graciously to attend to our humble requests, and to do for us all that we need, glorifying Yourself by us both in this present world, and in that which is to come: all of which we ask through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Our Father in heaven, Hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one: For Yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.</b></p>
<p class="p5">Benediction:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all. Amen.</b></p>
<p class="p5">After which the service may be concluded with a hymn. For service at the grave, see Appendix E.</p>
