<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><b>A. Licensure</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>19-1</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>To preserve the purity of the preaching of the Gospel, no man is permitted to preach in the pulpits of the Presbyterian Church in America on a regular basis without proper licensure from the Presbytery having jurisdiction where he will preach. An ordained teaching elder who is a member in good standing of another Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church in America may be licensed after being examined as to his views, according to the provision of <i>BCO</i> 13-6. This license shall immediately become void if the minister’s own Presbytery administers against him a censure of suspension from office or the sacraments, or deposition from office, or of excommunication (in the event of such censures, the Presbytery with jurisdiction shall always notify the licensing Presbytery). A ruling elder, a candidate for the ministry, a minister from some other denomination, or some other man may be licensed for the purpose of regularly providing the preaching of the Word upon his giving satisfaction to the Presbytery of his gifts and passing the licensure examination. (See also <i>BCO</i> 22-5 and 22-6.)</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>19-2</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Examination for Licensure.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The examination for licensure shall be as follows:</p>
<p class="p4" style="padding-left: 40px;">a.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Give a statement of his Christian experience and inward call to preach the Gospel in written form and/or orally before the Presbytery (at the discretion of the Presbytery);</p>
<p class="p4" style="padding-left: 40px;">b.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Be tested with a written and/or oral examination by the Presbytery (at the discretion of the Presbytery) for his:</p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 80px;">1.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>basic knowledge of Biblical doctrine as outlined in the <i>Confession of Faith</i> and <i>Larger and Shorter Catechisms</i> of the Presbyterian Church in America.</p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 80px;">2.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>practical knowledge of Bible content.</p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 80px;">3.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>basic knowledge of the government of the Presbyterian Church in America as defined in <i>The Book of Church Order</i>.</p>
<p class="p4" style="padding-left: 40px;">c.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Be examined orally before Presbytery for his views in the areas outlined in part b above.</p>
<p class="p4" style="padding-left: 40px;">d.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Provide his written sermon on an assigned passage of Scripture embodying both explanation and application, and present orally his sermon or exhortation before Presbytery or before a committee of Presbytery. </p>
<p class="p8" style="padding-left: 40px;">e.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>While our Constitution does not require the applicant’s affirmation of every statement and/or proposition of doctrine in our <i>Confession of Faith and Catechisms,</i> it is the right and responsibility of the Presbytery to determine if the applicant is out of accord with any of the fundamentals of these doctrinal standards and, as a consequence, may not be able in good faith sincerely to <span class="s2">receive and adopt the <i>Confession of Faith and Catechisms</i></span> of this church as containing the system of doctrine taught in the Holy Scriptures (cf. <i>BCO</i> 19-3, Q.2).</p>
<p class="p8" style="padding-left: 40px;">f.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Therefore, in examining an applicant for licensure, the Presbytery shall inquire not only into the candidate’s knowledge and views in the areas specified above, but also shall require the candidate to state the specific instances in which he may differ with the <i>Confession of Faith</i> and <i>Catechisms</i> in any of their statements and/or propositions. The court may grant an exception to any difference of doctrine only if in the court’s judgment the applicant’s declared difference is not out of accord with any fundamental of our system of doctrine because the difference is neither hostile to the system nor strikes at the vitals of religion.</p>
<p class="p9">
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>No Presbytery shall omit any of these parts of examination except in extraordinary cases; and whenever a Presbytery shall omit any of these parts, it shall always make a record of the reasons therefor, and of the trial parts omitted.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>19-3</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Questions for Licensure.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>If the Presbytery be satisfied with the trials of the applicant, it shall then proceed to license him in the following manner:</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The moderator shall propose to him the following questions, namely:</p>
<p class="p4" style="padding-left: 80px;"><b>1.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Do you believe the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, as originally given, to be the inerrant Word of God, the only infallible rule of faith and practice?</b></p>
<p class="p4" style="padding-left: 80px;"><b>2.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Do you sincerely receive and adopt the <i>Confession of Faith</i> and the <i>Catechisms</i> of this Church as containing the system of doctrine taught in the Holy Scripture?</b></p>
<p class="p4" style="padding-left: 80px;"><b>3.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Do you promise to strive for the purity, peace, unity and edification of the Church?</b></p>
<p class="p4" style="padding-left: 80px;"><b>4.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Do you promise to submit yourself, in the Lord, to the government of this Presbytery, or of any other into the bounds of which you may be called?</b></p>
<p class="p7">
<p class="p1"><b>19-4</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The applicant having answered these questions in the affirmative, the moderator shall offer a prayer suitable for the occasion, and shall address the applicant as follows: </p>
<p class="p11">
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><b>In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by that authority which He has given to the Church for its edification, we do license you to preach the Gospel in this Presbytery wherever God in His providence may call you; and for this purpose may the blessing of God rest upon you, and the Spirit of Christ fill your heart. Amen.</b></p>
<p class="p2" style="padding-left: 80px;"><b></b></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Record shall be made of the licensure in the following or like form:</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>At_____________, the __________day of_______________, the ____________________Presbytery, having received testimonials commending _________________________, proceeded to submit him to the prescribed examination for licensure, which was met to the approval of the Presbytery. Having satisfactorily answered the questions for licensure, _____________________ was licensed by the Presbytery to preach the Gospel within the bounds of this Presbytery.</b></p>
<p class="p13" style="padding-left: 80px;"><b></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>19-5</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>When any licentiate shall have occasion to remove from the bounds of his Presbytery into those of another, the latter Presbytery may, at its discretion, on his producing proper testimonials from the former, repeat any portion of the previous Presbytery’s examination it desires. The Presbytery into whose bounds the licentiate is moving, however, must at least examine the man concerning:</p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 40px;">a.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>his Christian experience,</p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 40px;">b.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>his call to preach the Gospel,</p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 40px;">c.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>his views in theology,</p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 40px;">d.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Bible content,</p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 40px;">e.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>church government. </p>
<p class="p1">This Presbytery then may license him to preach within its bounds.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>19-6</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The license to preach the Gospel shall expire at the end of four years. The Presbytery may, if it thinks proper, renew it without further examination. The licentiate must apply for renewal prior to expiration. If the license expires, the stated clerk shall report the expiration to the Presbytery and to the individual’s Session, and such action shall be recorded in the minutes. The procedures of <i>BCO</i> 19-2 must be followed for re-licensure and such fact shall be recorded in the minutes. The license may be terminated at any time by a simple majority vote of the issuing Presbytery. The Presbytery shall always record its reasons for this action in its minutes.</p>
<p class="p7">
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><b>B. Internship</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>19-7.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The Holy Scriptures require that some trial be previously made of those who are to be ordained to the ministry of the Word, both concerning their gifts and concerning their ability to rule as teaching elders, in order that this sacred office may not be degraded by being committed to weak or unworthy men, and that the Church may have an opportunity to form a better judgment respecting the gifts of those to whom this sacred office is to be committed. </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>To provide for such a period of trial, a candidate for ordination must serve an internship. This period of internship shall be at least one year in length, and may be longer at the discretion of the Presbytery so as to give sufficient time for the Presbytery to judge the candidate’s qualifications and service. This period of internship may occur during or after the candidate’s formal theological education. When it occurs during his formal theological education, it may include an intern year in addition to his time of academic training or it may run concurrent with his academic training.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The nature of the internship shall be determined by the Presbytery, but it should involve the candidate in full scope of the duties of any regular ministerial calling approved by the Presbytery. It is to be both a time of practical instruction and testing by the Presbytery, and may be in any work which the Presbytery deems to be a suitable ministry to test the intern’s gifts. The intern should be closely supervised by the Presbytery throughout this trial period.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>19-8</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>An applicant for internship must be a candidate and may be a licentiate in the Presbytery in which he is seeking to become an intern. He may, however, become a candidate, and an intern at the same meeting of Presbytery. If an applicant for internship is already a candidate in another Presbytery, that Presbytery should dismiss him as a candidate to the Presbytery in which he is seeking to become an intern.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>19-9</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Examination for Internship.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Before the applicant begins his period of internship, he shall give to the Presbytery a written and/or an oral statement (at the discretion of the Presbytery) of his inward call to the ministry of the Word.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>19-10</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>When an applicant is approved for internship, the moderator of the Presbytery shall offer a prayer suitable for the occasion, and shall address the applicant, if present, as follows:</p>
<p class="p7">
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><b>In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by that authority which He has given to the Church for its edification, we do declare you to be an intern of this Presbytery as a means of testing your gifts for the holy ministry wherever God in His providence may call you; and for this purpose may the blessing of God rest upon you, and the Spirit of Christ fill your heart. Amen.</b></p>
<p class="p2" style="padding-left: 80px;"><b></b></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Record shall be made of the internship in the following or like form, namely: </p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><b>At ______________, the ________ day of _____________________, the _____________________ Presbytery, having received testimonials commending ___________, having received him as a candidate for the ministry, has placed him under internship at his request in order to test his gifts for the holy ministry.</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>19-11</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>When any intern shall have occasion, while his internship is in progress, to remove from the bounds of his own Presbytery into those of another, the latter Presbytery may, at its discretion, on his producing proper testimonials from the former, take up his internship at the point at which it was left, and conduct it to a conclusion in the same manner as if it had been commenced by itself. Presbytery may repeat any portion of the previous Presbytery’s examination it desires.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>When God gives the intern the providential opportunity to serve the Church and to receive part of his training within the bounds of a Presbytery other than the one in which he has been declared an intern, the Presbyteries involved may develop a cooperative agreement to assure the proper training of the intern. In such cases the home Presbytery retains the final responsibility for and authority over the internship, but may rely to any extent considered necessary and proper in the circumstances, on the assistance of the sister Presbytery. When regular preaching of the Word is involved, care must be taken to comply with <i>BCO</i> 19-1.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>19-12.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Presbyteries should require interns to devote themselves diligently to the trial of their gifts; and no one should be ordained to the work of the ministry of the Word until he has demonstrated the ability both to edify and to rule in the Church. Reports on every intern in the Presbytery should be presented at each stated meeting of the Presbytery by the committee of Presbytery charged with the oversight of interns, and these reports shall become a part of the minutes of Presbytery. The Presbytery shall also require every intern himself to make a report to it at least once a year describing his ministerial experiences. If the intern is still in school, the Presbytery shall secure from his instructors an annual report upon his deportment, diligence, and progress in study.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>19-13.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>At the end of the period of time set by the Presbytery for his internship, an intern shall have his internship either approved or disapproved. Even if it is approved, he cannot be ordained without a call to some specific work. If the internship is disapproved, the Presbytery may either extend it for another definite period of time or it may completely rescind his intern status and may revoke his internship. If the intern shall devote himself unnecessarily to such pursuits as interfere with a full trial of his gifts, it shall be the duty of the Presbytery to rescind his intern status, and to record its reasons therefor in the minutes of Presbytery.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>19-14.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>An intern, who, during his internship, is to serve a congregation in <span class="s2">the capacity of the minister of the Word must be called by the congregation</span> in the same way that a regular minister is called. A congregation may later call such a man as its pastor. This call must be approved by Presbytery prior to the time of ordination. In the event a congregation does not desire to call such a man as its pastor as determined by a congregational vote, notice should be given as early as possible. Interns may be called to serve as assistants to ministers during their internship, by the Session of a church with approval of the call by Presbytery.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>19-15</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Restrictions.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The intern may be asked by the moderator of a Session temporarily to chair the meeting of the Session. In such cases the moderator shall supervise this activity and may overrule the intern or re-assume the chair at will. The intern is not a member of Session and may not vote in the meetings unless he has previously been ordained a Ruling Elder and elected to the Session by the congregation. Normally, he shall serve in an advisory capacity to the Session and Diaconate when he has been called to work out his internship by a congregation. He shall have the right to conduct funerals. An intern may not administer the Sacraments. He may serve on committees of the church he serves. </p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>19-16</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Where circumstances warrant, a Presbytery may approve previous experience which is equivalent to internship. This equivalency shall be decided by a three-fourths (3/4) vote of Presbytery at any of its regular meetings. Such equivalent experience shall be decided only after the Presbytery’s internship committee has determined and reported that the candidate has met the following requirements:</p>
<p class="p14" style="padding-left: 40px;">a.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><span class="s2">he has had at least one (1) year of experience in comparable ministry;</span></p>
<p class="p14" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">b. he has satisfactorily performed the full scope of ministerial duties;</span></p>
<p class="p14" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">c. he has the manifest approbation of God’s people in a local church as having the requisite gifts for the pastoral ministry.</span></p>
