<h2>CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</h2>
<h4 class="p1"><i>Evidence</i><i></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>35-1.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>All persons of proper age and intelligence are competent witnesses, except such as do not believe in the existence of God, or a future state of rewards and punishments. Either party has the right to challenge a witness whom he believes to be incompetent, and the court shall examine and decide upon his competency.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>35-2.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The accused party is allowed, but shall not be compelled, to testify; but the accuser shall be required to testify, on the demand of the accused. A husband or wife shall not be compelled to bear testimony against one another in any court.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>35-3.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>A court may, at the request of either party, or at its own initiative, make reasonable accommodation to prevent in-person contact with the accused:</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;">a.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The court may have testimony taken by videoconference. The videoconference shall employ technical means that ensure that all persons participating in the meeting can see and hear each other at the same time, and which allows for live cross-examination by both parties.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;">b.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The court may restrict the accused from appearing on the videoconference screen, and when the accused is represented by counsel (<i>BCO</i> 32-19), cross-examination shall be conducted by that counsel.</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;">c.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>In all cases where such accommodation has been made, videoconference testimony by witnesses under the age of 18 shall be taken by written interrogatory to be read to the witness by a person appointed by the court in accordance with the applicable provisions of <i>BCO</i> 35-11.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;">d.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The court shall include in the record of the proceedings its reasons for this accommodation and any objection from either party.</p>
<p class="p4">
<p class="p1"><b>35-4.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The testimony of more than one witness shall be necessary in order to establish any charge; yet if, in addition to the testimony of one witness, corroborative evidence be produced, the offense may be considered to be proved.</p>
<p class="p6">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>35-</b></span><span class="s2"><b>5</b></span><span class="s1"><b>.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span></span>It belongs to the court to judge the degree of credibility to be attached to all evidence.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>35-6.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>No witness afterwards to be examined, unless a member of the court, shall be present during the examination of another witness on the same case, if either party object.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p8"><b>35-7.</b> <span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Witnesses shall be examined first by the party introducing them; then cross-examined by the opposite party; after which any member of the court, or either party, may put additional interrogatories. No question shall be put or answered except by permission of the moderator, subject to an appeal to the court. The court shall not permit questions frivolous or irrelevant to the charge at issue.</p>
<p class="p9">
<p class="p1"><span class="s3"><b>35-8</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The oath or affirmation to a witness shall be administered by the Moderator in the following or like terms:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3"></span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s3"><b>Do you solemnly promise, in the presence of God, that you will declare the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, according to the best of your knowledge in the matter in which you are called to witness, as you shall answer it to the great Judge of the living and the dead?</b></span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s3"><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">If, however, at any time a witness should present himself before a court, who for conscientious reasons prefers to swear or affirm in any other manner, he should be allowed to do so.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><b>35-</b><span class="s4"><b>9</b></span><b>.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><span class="s3">All testimony shall be recorded (transcription, audiotape, videotape, or some other electronic means) and witnesses informed of such prior to testifying. Such recording becomes part of the Record of the Case. However, in order to be referenced in written or oral briefs, such recording must be transcribed and the transcription authenticated by the trial court. The court of final appeal may assess the cost of transcription equitably among the parties.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><b>35-10</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><span class="s5">The records of a court or any part of them, whether original or transcribed, if regularly authenticated by the moderator and clerk, or by either of them, shall be deemed good and sufficient evidence in every other court.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s5"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><b>35-</b><span class="s4"><b>11</b></span>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><span class="s6">In like manner, testimony taken by one court and regularly certified shall be received by every other court as no less valid than if it had been taken by itself.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s6"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><b>35-</b><span class="s4"><b>12</b></span>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><span class="s3">When it is not convenient for a court to have the whole or perhaps any part of the testimony in any particular case taken in its presence, a commission shall be appointed, or coordinate court requested, to take the testimony in question, which shall be considered as if taken in the presence of the court.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Due notice of the commission or coordinate court or videoconference, and of the time and place of its meeting, shall be given to the opposite party, that </span><span class="s3">he may have an opportunity of attending. If the accused shall desire on his part to take testimony at a distance for his own exculpation, he shall give notice to the court of the time and place at which it shall be taken, in order that a commission or coordinate court, as in the former case, may be appointed for the purpose. Testimony may be taken on written interrogatories by filing the same with the clerk of the court having jurisdiction of the case, and giving two weeks’ notice thereof to the adverse party, during which time he may file cross-interrogatories, if he desire it. Testimony shall then be taken by the commission or coordinate court in answer to the direct and cross-interrogatories, if such are filed, and no notice need be given of the time and place of taking the testimony.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s5"><b>35-</b></span><span class="s7"><b>13</b></span><span class="s5">.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>A member of the court shall not be disqualified from sitting as a judge</span> by having given testimony in the case, unless a party makes an objection, and the court subsequently determines that such member should be disqualified. The elder against whom the objection has been made shall retain the right to vote in the determination of qualification. A member of the court who is the prosecutor in the case (<i>BCO</i> 31-2) is disqualified from sitting as a judge.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>35-</b><span class="s4"><b>14</b></span>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>An officer or private member of the church refusing to testify may be censured for contumacy.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>35-15</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>If after trial before any court new testimony be discovered, which the accused believes important, it shall be his right to ask a new trial and it shall be within the power of the court to grant his request.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>35-</b><span class="s4"><b>16</b></span>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><span class="s3">If, in the prosecution of an appeal, new evidence be offered which, in the judgment of the appellate court, has an important bearing on the case, it shall be competent for that court to refer the case to the lower court for a new trial; or, with the consent of parties, to admit the evidence and proceed with the case.</span></p>
