<h2>CHAPTER FORTY-THREE</h2>
<h4 class="p1"><i>Complaints</i><i></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>43-1</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>A complaint is a written representation made against some act or decision of a court of the Church. It is the right of any communing member of the Church in good standing to make complaint against any action of a court to whose jurisdiction he is subject, except that no complaint is allowable in a judicial case after process has commenced. If, at any time after process has commenced, a <em>BCO</em> 43-1 complaint is timely filed, the court’s adjudication shall be delayed until after the judicial case has been completed, or, if an appeal is filed, after it has been fully adjudicated or withdrawn. During judicial process, the accused may raise <em>BCO</em> 32-14 objections on a variety of matters and the original court shall decide each. Those decisions could be reviewable on appeal.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p3"><b>43-2</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>A complaint shall first be made to the court whose act or decision is alleged to be in error. Written notice of complaint, with supporting reasons, shall be filed with the clerk of the court within sixty (60) days following the meeting of the court. The court shall consider the complaint at its next stated meeting, or at a called meeting prior to its next stated meeting, provided that the complaint has been filed with the clerk at least ten (10) days in advance. If the complaint is filed with less than ten (10) days’ notice, the court may consider the complaint at a later meeting not more than 60 days later.<b> </b>No attempt should be made to circularize the court to which complaint is being made by either party.</p>
<p class="p4">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>43-3</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>If, after considering a complaint, the court alleged to be delinquent or in</span> error is of the opinion that it has not erred, and denies the complaint, the complainant may take that complaint to the next higher court. If the lower court fails to consider the complaint against it by or at its next stated meeting, <span class="s2">provided that the complaint has been filed with the clerk at least ten (10) days in advance<b>, </b></span><span class="s1">the complainant may take that complaint to the next higher court. </span><span class="s2">If the complaint is filed with less than ten (10) days’ notice, the court may consider the complaint at a later meeting not more than 60 days later.<b> </b></span><span class="s1">Written notice</span> thereof shall be filed with both the clerk of the lower court and the clerk of the higher court within thirty (30) days of notification of the last court’s decision.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Notification of the last court’s decision shall be deemed to have occurred on the day of mailing (if certified, registered or express mail of a national postal service or any private service where verifying receipt is utilized), the day of hand delivery, or the day of confirmed receipt in the case of e-mail or facsimile. Furthermore, compliance with such requirements shall be deemed to have been fulfilled if a party cannot be located after diligent inquiry or if a party refuses to accept delivery.</p>
<p class="p6">
<p class="p1"><b>43-4</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Notice of complaint shall not have the effect of suspending the action against which the complaint is made, unless one-third (1/3) of the members present when the action was taken shall vote for its suspension, until the final decision in the higher court.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>43-5</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The court against which complaint is made shall appoint one or more representatives to defend its action before the higher court, and the parties in the case shall be known as complainant and respondent. The complainant himself may present his complaint, or he may obtain the assistance of a communing member of the Presbyterian Church in America, who is in good standing, in presenting his complaint.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>43-6</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>It shall be the duty of the clerk of the lower court to file with the clerk of the higher court, not more than thirty (30) days after receipt of notice of complaint, a copy of all its proceedings in connection with the complaint including the notice of complaint and supporting reasons, the response of the lower court, if any, and any papers bearing on the complaint. If the clerk of the lower court shall neglect to send up the proceedings on the complaint, he shall receive a proper rebuke from the higher court, and the act or decision complained against shall be suspended until the proceedings are produced so that the higher court can fairly consider the complaint.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>43-7</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The complainant shall be considered to have abandoned his complaint if he fails to appear before the higher court, in person or by counsel, for a hearing thereof, after he has been properly notified; but a complainant may waive, in writing, his right to appear with permission of the court and not be considered to have abandoned his case. In case of such failure to appear, the judgment of the lower court will stand unless the complainant gives to the court a prompt and satisfactory explanation.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>43-8.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span></b>Subject to the provisions below, after the higher court has decided that the notice filed with its clerk was timely and that the complaint is otherwise in order for it to be heard by the higher court, it shall hear the complaint, or in accordance with the provision of <i>BCO</i> 15-2 <span class="s4">and 15-3, appoint a commission to do so. Ordinarily the court or its commission</span> <span class="s4">shall schedule a hearing in a manner that reasonably accommodates the schedules</span> of the respective parties and affords each party a prior opportunity to file a written brief upon such terms and in accord with a briefing schedule established by the court or its commission in the reasonable exercise of its discretion.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>43-9</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>At the hearing, after all the papers bearing on the complaint have been read, the complainant and respondent will be given the opportunity to present argument, the complainant having the right of opening and closing the argument. After the hearing has been concluded, the court or the commission should go into closed session, and discuss and consider the merits of the complaint. The vote should then or later be taken as to what disposition should be made of the complaint, and the complainant and respondent notified of the court’s decision.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>43-10</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The higher court has power, in its discretion, to annul the whole or any part of the action of a lower court against which complaint has been made, or to send the matter back to the lower court with instructions for a new hearing. If the higher court rules a lower court erred by not indicting someone, and the lower court refers the matter back to the higher court, it shall accept the reference if it is a doctrinal case or case of public scandal (see <i>BCO</i> 41-3).</p>
