<h2>CHAPTER FORTY-NINE</h2>
<h4 class="p1"><i>The Ordering of Public Worship</i><i></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>49-1</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>When the congregation is to meet for public worship, the people (having before prepared their hearts thereunto) ought all to come and join therein; not absenting themselves from the public ordinances through negligence, or upon pretence of private meetings.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>49-2</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Let the people assemble at the appointed time, that all being present at the beginning they may unite with one heart in all the parts of public worship. Let none unnecessarily depart until after the blessing be pronounced.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>49-3</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Let the people upon entering the church take their seats in a decent and reverent manner, and engage in a silent prayer for a blessing upon themselves, the minister, and all present, as well as upon those who are unable to attend worship.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>49-4</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>All who attend public worship are expected to be present in a spirit of reverence and godly fear, forbearing to engage in any conduct unbecoming to the place and occasion. Since the family, as ordained by God, is the basic institution in society, and God in the Covenant graciously deals with us, not just as individuals but also as families, it is important and desirable that families worship together.</p>
