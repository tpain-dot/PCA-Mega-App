<h2>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h2>
<h4 class="p1"><i>Church Orders – The Doctrine of Vocation</i><i></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>16-1</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Ordinary vocation to office in the Church is the calling of God by the Spirit, through the inward testimony of a good conscience, the manifest approbation of God’s people, and the concurring judgment of a lawful court of the Church.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>16-2</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The government of the Church is by officers gifted to represent Christ, and the right of God’s people to recognize by election to office those so gifted is inalienable. Therefore no man can be placed over a church in any office without the election, or at least the consent of that church.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>16-3</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Upon those whom God calls to bear office in His Church He bestows suitable gifts for the discharge of their various duties. And it is indispensable that, besides possessing the necessary gifts and abilities, natural and acquired, every one admitted to an office should be sound in the faith, and his life be according to godliness. Wherefore every candidate for office is to be approved by the court by which he is to be ordained.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>16-4</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Officers in the Presbyterian Church in America must be above reproach in their walk and Christlike in their character. While office bearers will see spiritual perfection only in glory, they will continue in this life to confess and to mortify remaining sins in light of God’s work of progressive sanctification. Therefore, to be qualified for office, they must affirm the sinfulness of fallen desires, the reality and hope of progressive sanctification, and be committed to the pursuit of Spirit-empowered victory over their sinful temptations, inclinations, and actions.</p>
