<p class="p1"><b>51-3</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>It is recommended that Psalms be sung along with the hymns of the Church, but that caution be observed in the selection of hymns, that they be true to the Word. Hymns should have the note of praise, or be in accord with the spirit of the sermon.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>51-4</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The leadership in song is left to the judgment of the Session, who should give careful thought to the character of those asked to lead in this part of worship, and the singing of a choir should not be allowed to displace congregational singing.</p>
