<p class="p1"><b>1.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Our first parents, being seduced by the subtilty and temptation of Satan, sinned, in eating the forbidden fruit. This their sin, God was pleased, according to his wise and holy counsel, to permit, having purposed to order it to his own glory.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>2.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>By this sin they fell from their original righteousness and communion with God, and so became dead in sin, and wholly defiled in all the parts and faculties of soul and body.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>3.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>They being the root of all mankind, the guilt of this sin was imputed; and the same death in sin, and corrupted nature, conveyed to all their posterity descending from them by ordinary generation.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>4.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>From this original corruption, whereby we are utterly indisposed, disabled, and made opposite to all good, and wholly inclined to all evil, do proceed all actual transgressions.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>5.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>This corruption of nature, during this life, doth remain in those that are regenerated; and although it be, through Christ, pardoned, and mortified; yet both itself, and all the motions thereof, are truly and properly sin.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>6.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Every sin, both original and actual, being a transgression of the righteous law of God, and contrary thereunto, doth, in its own nature, bring guilt upon the sinner, whereby he is bound over to the wrath of God, and curse of the law, and so made subject to death, with all miseries spiritual, temporal, and eternal.</p>
