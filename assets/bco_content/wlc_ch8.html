<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Redemption is certainly applied, and effectually communicated, to all those for whom Christ hath purchased it; who are in time by the Holy Ghost enabled to believe in Christ according to the gospel.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The visible church hath the privilege of being under God’s special care and government; of being protected and preserved in all ages, notwithstanding the opposition of all enemies; and of enjoying the communion of saints, the ordinary means of salvation, and offers of grace by Christ to all the members of it in the ministry of the gospel, testifying, that whosoever believes in him shall be saved, and excluding none that will come unto him.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The union which the elect have with Christ is the work of God’s grace, whereby they are spiritually and mystically, yet really and inseparably, joined to Christ as their head and husband; which is done in their effectual calling.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 67.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>What is effectual calling?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Effectual calling is the work of God’s almighty power and grace, whereby (out of his free and special love to his elect, and from nothing in them moving him thereunto) he doth, in his accepted time, invite and draw them to Jesus Christ, by his Word and Spirit; savingly enlightening their minds, renewing and powerfully determining their wills, so as they (although in themselves dead in sin) are hereby made willing and able freely to answer his call, and to accept and embrace the grace offered and conveyed therein.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 68.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Are the elect only effectually called?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>All the elect, and they only, are effectually called; although others may be, and often are, outwardly called by the ministry of the Word, and have some common operations of the Spirit; who, for their willful neglect and contempt of the grace offered to them, being justly left in their unbelief, do never truly come to Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The communion in grace which the members of the invisible church have with Christ, is their partaking of the virtue of his mediation, in their justification, adoption, sanctification, and whatever else, in this life, manifests their union with him.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 70.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>What is justification?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Justification is an act of God’s free grace unto sinners, in which he pardoneth all their sins, accepteth and accounteth their persons righteous in his sight; not for anything wrought in them, or done by them, but only for the perfect obedience and full satisfaction of Christ, by God imputed to them, and received by faith alone.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 71.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>How is justification an act of God’s free grace?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Although Christ, by his obedience and death, did make a proper, real, and full satisfaction to God’s justice in the behalf of them that are justified; yet inasmuch as God accepteth the satisfaction from a surety, which he might have demanded of them, and did provide this surety, his own only Son, imputing his righteousness to them, and requiring nothing of them for their justification but faith, which also is his gift, their justification is to them of free grace.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 72.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>What is justifying faith?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Justifying faith is a saving grace, wrought in the heart of a sinner by the Spirit and Word of God, whereby he, being convinced of his sin and misery, and of the disability in himself and all other creatures to recover him out of his lost condition, not only assenteth to the truth of the promise of the gospel, but receiveth and resteth upon Christ and his righteousness, therein held forth, for pardon of sin, and for the accepting and accounting of his person righteous in the sight of God for salvation.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 73.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>How doth faith justify a sinner in the sight of God?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Faith justifies a sinner in the sight of God, not because of those other graces which do always accompany it, or of good works that are the fruits of it, nor as if the grace of faith, or any act thereof, were imputed to him for his justification; but only as it is an instrument by which he receiveth and applieth Christ and his righteousness.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 74.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>What is adoption?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Adoption is an act of the free grace of God, in and for his only Son Jesus Christ, whereby all those that are justified are received into the number of his children, have his name put upon them, the Spirit of his Son given to them, are under his fatherly care and dispensations, admitted to all the liberties and privileges of the sons of God, made heirs of all the promises, and fellow heirs with Christ in glory.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 75.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>What is sanctification?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Sanctification is a work of God’s grace, whereby they whom God hath, before the foundation of the world, chosen to be holy, are in time, through the powerful operation of his Spirit applying the death and resurrection of Christ unto them, renewed in their whole man after the image of God; having the seeds of repentance unto life, and all other saving graces, put into their hearts, and those graces so stirred up, increased, and strengthened, as that they more and more die unto sin, and rise unto newness of life.</p>
