<h4 class="p3"><em>GRAVESIDE SERVICE</em></h4>
<p class="p5">After the body has been lowered into the grave (or to sea), the following words may be said:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s6"><b>Forasmuch as it has pleased Almighty God, in His wise providence, to take out of this world the soul of our deceased (brother), we therefore commit (his) body to the ground; earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust: awaiting the hour when all who are in the graves will hear the voice of the Son of God, and come forth, “those who have done good, to the resurrection of life and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation” (John 5:29).</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s6"><b>But I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who have fallen asleep, lest you sorrow as others who have not hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus (1 Thessalonians 4:13-14).</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s6"><b>Then I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, “Write: ‘Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.’” “Yes,” says the Spirit, “that they may rest from their labors, and their works follow them” (Revelation 14:13).</b></span></p>
<p class="p5">Prayer:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s7"><b>Almighty God, who has sanctified the grave by Your Son’s rest therein, and by His glorious resurrection has brought life and immortality to light, accept, we pray, our unfeigned thanks for the victory which He has obtained for us and for all who sleep in Him, and keep us who are still in the body, in everlasting fellowship with all that wait for You on earth, and with all that are around You in heaven, in union with Him who is the resurrection and the life, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Ghost, ever one God, world without end. Amen.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s7"><b>O Merciful God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the resurrection and the life; in whom whosoever believes, shall live, though he die; and whosoever lives and believes in Him, shall not die eternally; who also has taught us, by His holy Apostle Paul, not to be sorry, as men without hope, for those who sleep in Him; we humbly beseech You, O Father, to raise us from the death of sin unto the life of righteousness; that when we shall depart this life, we may rest in Him; and that, at the general resurrection in the last day, we may be found acceptable in Your sight; and receive that blessing, which Your well-beloved Son shall then pronounce to all who love and fear You, saying, Come, blessed children of my Father, receive the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world. Grant this, we beseech You O merciful Father, through Jesus Christ, our Mediator and Redeemer. Amen.*</b></span></p>
<p class="p1">Benediction:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Now may the God of peace who brought up our Lord Jesus from the dead, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, make you complete in every good work to do His will, working in you what is well pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen (Hebrews 13:20-21).</b></p>
