<h4 class="p3"><em>THE DEDICATION OF A CHURCH BUILDING</em></h4>
<p class="p5">The congregation shall stand, and the following portions from the Psalter shall be read by the presiding minister and the people responsively, or, if desired, by the minister alone.</p>
<p class="p23" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>Make a joyful shout to the Lord, all you lands! Serve the Lord with gladness; come before His presence with singing. Know that the Lord, He is God; it is He who has made us, and not we ourselves; we are His people and the sheep of his pasture. Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with praise. Be thankful to Him, and bless His name. For the Lord is good; His mercy is everlasting, and His truth endures to all generations (Psalm 100).</b></span></p>
<p class="p23" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>I was glad when they said to me, “Let us go into the house of the Lord.” Our feet have been standing within your gates, O Jerusalem! Jerusalem is built as a city that is compact together, where the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, to the Testimony of Israel, to give thanks to the name of the Lord. For thrones are set there for judgment, the thrones of the house of David. Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: “May they prosper who love you. Peace be within your walls, prosperity within your palaces.” For the sake of my brethren and companions, I will now say, “Peace be within you.” Because of the house of the Lord our God I will seek your good (Psalm 122).</b></span></p>
<p class="p23" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>How lovely is Your tabernacle, O Lord of Hosts! My soul longs, yes, even faints for the court of the Lord; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God. Even the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young &#8212; even Your altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God. Blessed are those who dwell in Your house; they will still be praising You. &#8230; For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of wickedness (Psalm 84:1-4, 10).</b></span></p>
<p class="p23" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>The earth is the Lord’s, and all its fullness, the world and those who dwell therein. For He has founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the waters. Who may ascend into the hill of the Lord? Or who may stand in His holy place? He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who has not lifted up his soul to an idol, nor sworn deceitfully. He shall receive blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. This is Jacob, the generation of those who seek Him, who seek Your face. Selah. Lift up your heads, O you gates! And be lifted up, you everlasting doors! And the King of glory shall come in. Who is the King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, The Lord mighty in battle. Lift up your heads, O you gates! And lift them up, you everlasting doors! And the King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, He is the King of glory. Selah (Psalm 24).</b></span></p>
<p class="p5">The minister shall say:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Beloved in the lord, we are gathered to consecrate and set apart this house for the worship of the one living and true God. Let us therefore dedicate this place to its proper and sacred uses.</b></p>
<p class="p5">Then the minister and the people shall say responsively:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>To You, God and Father of Jesus Christ, our Lord:</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b> <i>We dedicate this house.</i></b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>To You, eternal Son of God, Redeemer of Your people and Head of Thy church:</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b> <i>We dedicate this house.</i></b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>To You, Spirit of God, lord and giver of life, our teacher, sanctifier and comforter:</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b> <i>We dedicate this house.</i></b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>For the worship of God in praise and prayer;</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>For the preaching of the gospel of the grace of God;</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>For the celebration of the holy Sacraments:</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b> <i>We dedicate this house.</i></b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>For the diffusion of sacred knowledge;</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>For the promotion of righteousness;</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>For the extension of the kingdom of God:</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b> <i>We dedicate this house.</i></b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>For release of the captives;</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>For recovering of sight to the blind;</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>For rest to the heavy laden:</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b> <i>We dedicate this house.</i></b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>For comfort to those who mourn;</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>For strength to those who are tempted;</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>For assurance to those of little faith:</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b> <i>We dedicate this house.</i></b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>For the sanctifying of the family;</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>For the nurture of the young;</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>For the perfection of believers:</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b> <i>We dedicate this house.</i></b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>In gratitude for the gracious keeping of the divine covenant throughout past generations;</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>In reliance upon the promise that the gates of hell shall not prevail against the church;</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>In the hope of the eternal glory of the Church Triumphant:</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b> <i>We dedicate this house.</i></b></p>
<p class="p5">Then the minister shall say:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Beloved in the Lord, seeing that it has pleased Almighty God to prosper us in our undertaking to build (or secure) a house for His worship, let us now invoke upon it His abiding blessing, to the end that pure apostolic doctrine and order may be maintained herein, and that the Holy Spirit may make His own ordinances effectual. In so doing let us reverently set this house apart for these sacred uses with prayer and supplication.</b></p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b> Let us pray:</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>Almighty and everlasting God, maker of heaven and earth, who dwells in the high and holy place, with Him also who is of contrite and humble spirit, we adore You for Your manifold perfections, for the infinite majesty and glorious beauty of Your being, and for the truthfulness and sanctity of Your divine revelation.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>We give thanks unto You for Your infinite mercies to us, and, in particular, for the gift of Your Son to be our Saviour. We praise You for the Church of God, of which He is the only Head and King and of which we are humble and unfaithful members. We acknowledge that we are not worthy to receive from Your hand the blessings of Your common grace; and especially do we recognize the abundance of Your great goodness in granting to us, through Your particular grace, membership in the Church Universal, the mystical Body of Christ.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>You have put it into our hearts to prepare this house of worship where men may gather in Your service. We earnestly beseech You that You will watch over and protect this place which we have dedicated in Your name. We ask that here may be preached only the pure Gospel of the free grace of God. May all that is proclaimed be firmly grounded upon the unchanging foundation of Holy Scripture. Grant that no portion of Your sacred revelation to man may be neglected but that Your servants who minister here shall give to all its parts that due regard which will exhibit its majesty and scope. We pray that by the favor of Your Spirit sinners may in this house be converted unto You, and that the saints of God, the members of Your holy body, may be built up and edified by the proclamation of Your matchless Word.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s5"><b>May the Holy Spirit of God, the third person of the blessed Trinity ever be present to guide, illumine and inform those who teach here. May He prepare the hearts of the hearers to receive with meekness the instruction which is presented, so that their lives may show forth the wonders of His grace and truly adorn the doctrine of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Bless this Your house that it may serve without surcease the extension of the kingdom of God. Teach us to look for the return of the Lord of glory that we shall be quickened day by day in our present service of Him, and shall be always prepared to greet Him and to enter in with Him to the marriage supper of the Lamb, forever to dwell in that holy city where there is no candle neither light of the sun for the Lamb is the light thereof.</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen (1 Timothy 1:17).</b></p>
<p class="p5">An offering to the Lord may then be received.</p>
<p class="p5">After the singing of an appropriate psalm or hymn, a sermon shall be preached.</p>
