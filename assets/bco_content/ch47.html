<h2>CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN</h2>
<h4 class="p1"><i>The Principles and Elements of Public Worship</i><i></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>47-1</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Since the Holy Scriptures are the only infallible rule of faith and practice, the principles of public worship must be derived from the Bible, and from no other source.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The Scriptures forbid the worshipping of God by images, or in any other way not appointed in His Word, and requires the receiving, observing, and keeping pure and entire all such religious worship and ordinances as God hath appointed in His Word (<i>WSC</i> 51, 50).</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>47-2</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>A service of public worship is not merely a gathering of God’s children with each other, but before all else, a meeting of the triune God with His chosen people. God is present in public worship not only by virtue of the Divine omnipresence but, much more intimately, as the faithful covenant Savior. The Lord Jesus Christ said: “Where two or three are gathered together in My name there I am in the midst of them” (Matthew 18:20).</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p3"><b>47-3</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The end of public worship is the glory of God. His people should engage in all its several parts with an eye single to His glory. Public worship has as its aim the building of Christ’s Church by the perfecting of the saints <span class="s1">and the addition to its membership of such as are being saved—all to the glory</span> of God. Through public worship on the Lord’s day Christians should learn to serve God all the days of the week in their every activity, remembering, whether they eat or drink, or whatever they do, to do all to the glory of God (1 Corinthians 10:31).</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>47-4</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Public worship is Christian when the worshippers recognize that Christ is the Mediator by whom alone they can come unto God, when they honor Christ as the head of the Church, who rules over public worship, and when their worship is an expression of their faith in Christ and of their love for Him.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>47-5</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Public worship must be performed in spirit and in truth. Externalism and hypocrisy stand condemned. The forms of public worship have value only when they serve to express the inner reverence of the worshipper and his sincere devotion to the true and living God. And only those whose hearts have been renewed by the Holy Spirit are capable of such reverence and devotion.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>47-6</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The Lord Jesus Christ has prescribed no fixed forms for public worship but, in the interest of life and power in worship, has given His Church a large measure of liberty in this matter. It may not be forgotten, however, that there is true liberty only where the rules of God’s Word are observed and the Spirit of the Lord is, that all things must be done decently and in order, and that God’s people should serve Him with reverence and in the beauty of holiness. From its beginning to its end a service of public worship should be characterized by that simplicity which is an evidence of sincerity and by that beauty and dignity which are a manifestation of holiness.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>47-7</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Public worship differs from private worship in that in public worship God is served by His saints unitedly as His covenant people, the Body of Christ. For this reason the covenant children should be present so far as possible as well as adults. For the same reason no favoritism may be shown to any who attend. Nor may any member of the church presume to exalt himself above others as though he were more spiritual, but each shall esteem others better than himself.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>47-8</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>It behooves God’s people not only to come into His presence with a deep sense of awe at the thought of His perfect holiness and their own exceeding sinfulness, but also to enter into His gates with thanksgiving and into His courts with praise for the great salvation, which He has so graciously wrought for them through his only begotten Son and applied to them by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="p5">
<p class="p1"><b>47-9</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The Bible teaches that the following are proper elements of worship service: reading of Holy Scripture, singing of psalms and hymns, the offering of prayer, the preaching of the Word, the presentation of offerings, confessing the faith and observing the Sacraments; and on special occasions taking oaths.</p>
