<h2>CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</h2>
<h4 class="p1"><i>The Infliction of Church Censures</i><i></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>36-1</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>When any member or officer of the Church shall be found guilty of an offense the court shall proceed with all tenderness and shall deal with its offending brother in the spirit of meekness, the members considering themselves lest they also be tempted.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>36-2</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Church censures and the modes of administering them should be suited to the nature of the offenses. For private offenses, censure should be administered in the presence of the court alone, or in private by one or more members of the court. In the case of public offenses, the degree of censure and mode of administering it shall be within the discretion of the court, acting in accordance with paragraphs below which deal with particular censures.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>36-3</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The Censure of Admonition should be administered in private by one or more members of the court if the offense is known only to a few and is not aggravated in character. If the offense is public the Admonition should be administered by the moderator in presence of the court and may also be announced in public should the court deem it expedient.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>36-4</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Definite suspension from office should be administered in the presence of the court alone or in open session of the court, as it may deem best, and public announcement thereof shall be at the court’s discretion.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>36-5</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Indefinite suspension from office or the Sacraments should be administered after the manner prescribed for definite suspension, but with added solemnity, that the indefinite suspension may be the means of impressing the mind of the delinquent with a proper sense of his danger. Indefinite suspension should also be administered under the blessing of God of leading him to repentance. When the court has resolved to pass this sentence, the moderator shall address the offending brother to the following purpose:</p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Whereas, you, ___________________ (here describe the person as a teaching elder, ruling elder, deacon, or private member of the church) are convicted by sufficient proof (or are guilty by your own confession) of the sin of ______________ (here insert the offense), we the _______________________ Presbytery (or Church Session) in the name and by the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ, do now declare you suspended from the Sacraments of the Church (and from the exercise of your office), until you give satisfactory evidence of repentance.</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>To this shall be added such advice or admonition as may be judged necessary, and the whole shall be concluded with prayer to almighty God that He would follow this act of discipline with His blessing.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>36-6</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Excommunication is to be administered according to one or other of the two modes laid down for indefinite suspension, or to be inflicted in public as the court may decide. In administering this censure the moderator of the Session shall make a statement of the several steps which have been taken with respect to the offending brother, and of the decision to cut him off from the communion of the church. He shall then show from Matthew 18:15-18 and 1 Corinthians 5:1-5 the authority of the church to cast out unworthy members, and shall explain the nature, use and consequences of this censure. He shall then administer the censure in the words following:</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Whereas, _________________________, a member of this church has been by sufficient proof convicted of the sin of _______________________, and after much admonition and prayer, obstinately refuses to hear the Church, and has manifested no evidence of repentance: Therefore, in the name and by the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ, we, the Session of ________________________ church do pronounce him to be excluded from the Sacraments, and cut off from the fellowship of the Church.</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Prayer shall then be made that by God’s blessing this solemn action of the court may issue in the repentance and restoration of the offender, and in the establishment of all true believers.</p>
<p class="p4">
<p class="p1"><b>36-7</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The censure of deposition shall be administered by the moderator in the words following:</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Whereas, ____________________, a teaching elder of this Presbytery (or ruling elder or deacon of this church), has been proved, by sufficient evidence to be guilty of the sin of ____________________, we, the ____________________ Presbytery (or Church Session), do adjudge him disqualified for the office of the Christian ministry (or ruling eldership, or deaconship), and therefore we do hereby, in the name and by the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ, depose from the office of a teaching elder (or ruling elder or deacon) the said ____________________, and do prohibit him from exercising any of the functions thereof.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><b></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>If the censure includes suspension or excommunication, the moderator shall proceed to say:</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>We do moreover, by the same authority, suspend the said ____________________ from the Sacraments of the Church, until he shall exhibit satisfactory evidence of sincere repentance,</b></p>
<p class="p6"><b></b></p>
<p class="p7">or</p>
<p class="p6">
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>We do moreover, by the same authority, exclude the said ____________________ from the Sacraments, and cut him off from the fellowship of the Church.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><b></b></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The sentence of deposition ought to be inflicted with solemnities similar to those already prescribed in the case of excommunication.</p>
