<p class="p6"><b>4-5.</b> The membership of Committees or Agencies shall be limited to the constitutional provisions for the permanent Committees or Agencies (<i>BCO</i> 14-1.12): namely, that those who have served for at least a full term, or at least two years of a partial term on one of the Assembly’s permanent Committees or Agencies shall not be eligible for re-election to an Assembly Committee or Agency until one year has elapsed, unless provision has been approved by the Agency bylaws.

<p class="p15" style="padding-left: 40px;">c. The staff of a subcommittee is controlled by the permanent Committee or Agency through its chief administrative officer.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>4-11. </b>The budget for each permanent Committee and Agency shall be submitted to the Administrative Committee of General Assembly, which shall independently evaluate the proposed budget of each permanent Committee and Agency and report to the Assembly its considered opinion on the adoption. To protect the ministry and<b> </b>fiduciary responsibilities of the Committees and Agency Boards, the financial coordination and independent evaluation of the budgets by the Administrative Committee shall be for review, discussion, and recommendation to the Assembly.</p>
<p class="p6">Should modifications in budgets be deemed necessary by the Assembly, special care shall be taken that changes not be made in such a way as to threaten the continuity or effectiveness of the Committee’s or Agency’s ministry. Budgets of permanent Committees and Agencies that are agreed upon by the Administrative Committee may be changed only by a two-thirds vote of the Assembly commissioners present and voting at the time the budget is submitted for adoption. In the event the Administrative Committee disagrees with the budget submitted by one of the Committees or Boards, in whole or any item thereof, the General Assembly may adopt either the Committee’s or Board’s budget or the Administrative Committee’s recommended budget by simple majority. The requirement of a two-thirds vote of the General Assembly applies only to changes not recommended by the Administrative Committee, initiated on the floor of the Assembly. With respect to the Committees and Agencies, financial coordination is through the Administrative Committee to the Assembly and from the General Assembly to the Committees and Agencies. The Administrative Committee is a “filter upward” and has no downward authority.</p>
<p class="p6">The Administrative Committee shall annually provide and publish guidelines for the Partnership Share Giving Program of the PCA, including the Ministry Ask. These guidelines shall include statistical information expressed both in per capita giving terms and in proportional (percentage) giving terms to demonstrate the giving necessary to attain full funding for budgets of the General Assembly Committees and Agencies.</p>
<p class="p6">The Committees and Agencies receiving support through the PCA Partnership Share Giving Program shall present their financial needs and their Ministry Ask to the Administrative Committee for review and recommendation in the course of the regular budgeting process. Each Committee and Agency shall then be free to request from the PCA churches and constituency the contributions necessary to fund its approved budget.</p>
<p class="p6">While all churches remain free to give their contributions as they by God’s guidance determine, all churches are encouraged to give, as they are able, at least ten percent (10%) of their tithes and offerings to the PCA causes of presbyteries and General Assembly.</p>
<p class="p6">The Administrative Committee shall maintain a manual containing <span class="s3">the Affirmation of Core Financial Standards. This information, by which each</span> PCA General Assembly ministry (Committee or Agency) shall function and by which the budget process is governed for each Committee and Agency, shall be available to all constituencies.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>4-12.</b> All funds received by the Corporation that are designated for the benefit of any particular permanent Committee or Agency shall be disbursed by the treasurer to the proper Committee or Agency.

<p class="p6"><b>4-13.</b> Each permanent Committee or Agency, by resolution adopted by a majority of its Committee or Board members, may designate the place, date, and time for its regular meetings, which should be held as needed, but no less than twice a year. Written or printed notice of such resolution should be given to all Committee or Board members within a reasonable time after the adoption thereof. Notice of the time, place or purpose of such regular meetings of the permanent Committee or Board shall not be required to be given.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>4-14.</b> Special meetings of the permanent Committees and Agencies may be called at any time or place by the chairman of the Committee or Board, or by a majority of the Committee or Board members. Written notice stating the place, date, and hour of such special meeting shall be delivered by the chairman of the Committee or Board to each Committee or Board member at least ten days prior to the date of such meetings, and such notice should specify the purpose of such special meetings. Attendance of a Committee or Board member at such a meeting will constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting. The act of the majority of the Committee or Board members present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Committee or Board.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>4-15.</b> A majority of a permanent Committee or Board shall constitute a quorum.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>4-16.</b> The chairman, vice-chairman, secretary, and any other officers of each permanent Committee or Agency shall be elected annually at the last regular meeting of the Committee or Board prior to the meeting of the General Assembly. Notice of this meeting shall include notice to the effect that these elections shall take place.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>4-17.</b> In the event any administrative personnel employed by a Committee or Agency and approved by the General Assembly resigns, dies, or is unable to act, such Committee or Agency may employ a provisional replacement, who has been examined and approved by the Assembly&#8217;s Theological Examining Committee, and who shall serve until the next General Assembly.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>4-18. </b>Chairmen of special committees (4-4), subcommittees, commissions including the SJC, ad interim committees, and study committees (9-1–9-4 ) that are funded through the Administrative Committee or whose funds are administered by the Administrative Committee, have the authority to call, postpone, or cancel meetings. The Stated Clerk has the authority and responsibility to notify the chairman that a meeting(s) to be held between Assemblies will not be funded if the resources are not sufficient to meet the General Assembly defined spending requirements. These requirements dictate that Committee and Agency expenses not exceed income and reserve levels.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>4-19. </b>Copies of all permanent Committee and Agency meeting agendas and minutes shall be sent, in a timely manner, to all chairmen and chief administrative officers of the General Assembly permanent Committees and Agencies.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>4-20. </b>All chairmen and chief administrative officers of the General Assembly permanent Committees and Agencies (or their designees) shall be given the opportunity to attend (at the expense of their respective permanent Committee or Agency) any meeting of any permanent Committee or Agency.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>4-21. Guidelines for Keeping Minutes of Permanent Committees and Agencies of the General Assembly</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p15" style="padding-left: 40px;">a. The minutes of Assembly Committees and Agencies should be kept either in a lock-type record book, with numbered pages, or be printed, mimeographed, or otherwise reproduced.</p>
<p class="p15" style="padding-left: 40px;">b. The minutes should be typewritten or printed, or reproduced from typewritten masters, and should be neat and legible.</p>
<p class="p15" style="padding-left: 40px;">c. The opening paragraphs of the minutes should contain the following information (which need not, however, be divided into numbered or separate items):</p>
<p class="p20" style="padding-left: 80px;">1) The kind of meeting: regular, called, adjourned regular, or adjourned called;</p>
<p class="p20" style="padding-left: 80px;">2) The name of the Committee or Agency;</p>
<p class="p20" style="padding-left: 80px;">3) The date and time of the meeting, and the place;</p>
<p class="p20" style="padding-left: 80px;">4) The name of the chairman, and if someone other than the regular secretary served as a clerk pro-tem, his name should be indicated;</p>
<p class="p20" style="padding-left: 80px;">5) If the minutes of the previous meeting were not approved at that meeting, a record of their having been read and approved by this session should be indicated, including the date of the minutes being so approved.</p>
<p class="p20" style="padding-left: 80px;">6) The names of those present at the meeting should be recorded, indicating whether they were teaching elders or ruling elders, and the presbytery represented in each case. The names of alternate elders and their respective churches should also be included, and the names of visitors should be included.</p>
<p class="p21" style="padding-left: 40px;">d. The contents of the minutes should include the following items:</p>
<p class="p20" style="padding-left: 80px;">1) The names of persons leading in opening and closing prayers at all sessions;</p>
<p class="p20" style="padding-left: 80px;">2) In the event of a called meeting, the portion of the call stating the purpose of the meeting should be recorded verbatim in the minutes;</p>
<p class="p20" style="padding-left: 80px;">3) A recording of the actions of the Committee or Board, including all motions adopted and business transacted, together with such additional information as the Committee or Board deems desirable for historical purposes. Ordinarily in church courts, motions that are lost are not included in the record unless an affirmative vote for the lost motion is recorded, in which case the lost motion must be shown. Each main motion should normally be recorded in a separate paragraph. Subsidiary and procedural motions may be recorded in the same paragraph with the main motion to which they pertain. Main motions may be recorded in the same paragraph if they are closely related and pertain to the same item of business.</p>
<p class="p20" style="padding-left: 80px;">4) A recording of information sufficient to demonstrate the Committee&#8217;s or Board’s implementation of instructions received from General Assembly and of material policies and material policy changes adopted by the Committee or Board in that year.</p>
<p class="p20" style="padding-left: 80px;">5) If a Committee or Agency is a higher education institution, the minutes shall include the following data, updated annually and delineated by degree program: total student enrollment, number of students by full-time or part-time status, number of students by gender, and number of students by learning modality (whether in-person, online, or hybrid). The minutes should indicate that the data have been reviewed by the respective Committee or Board.</p>
<p class="p15" style="padding-left: 40px;">e. It may be desirable to number these paragraphs consecutively, and to give a title over each paragraph indicating succinctly the content of business included. This is not mandatory, but is desirable for the later reading of the minutes. For historical purposes, some notes as to the extent and kind of debate may be included, but minutes should never reflect the secretary’s opinion, favorable or otherwise, on anything said or done.</p>
<p class="p15" style="padding-left: 40px;">f. The minutes of the Committees and Boards should appear in the minute book in the order in which the meetings occur. When a previous action of the Committee or Board is cited, the date should be given, and the volume and page and paragraph number.</p>
<p class="p15" style="padding-left: 40px;">g. The minutes of each meeting should be signed by the secretary.</p>
<p class="p15" style="padding-left: 40px;">h. The chief administrative officer, if there be one, and if not, the chairman, shall be responsible for the custody of the minutes of the Committee or Agency. He is responsible for the presentation to the General Assembly for approval of all minutes of the Committee or Agency which have been approved by the Committee or Agency not previously approved by the General Assembly. All other minutes of the Committee or Agency to which specific reference is made in the minutes submitted to the General Assembly for approval shall be submitted for purposes of information.</p>
<p class="p15" style="padding-left: 40px;">i. A copy of the <b>Guidelines for Keeping Committee or Agency Minutes</b> should be kept with the minutes of the Committee or Agency.</p>
<p class="p15" style="padding-left: 40px;">j. An up-to-date copy of the bylaws and manual of the Committee or Agency, if such exist, should be kept with the minutes.</p>

In the event that presbytery does not have sufficient teaching elders to supply the committees thus assigned, the presbytery may, at its own discretion, elect ruling elders to these committees (or vice versa, may elect teaching elders for insufficient ruling elders). In the event that presbytery is not able to supply members for all the committees, the presbytery may select the committees to which they wish to appoint representatives. Commissioners serving on permanent Committees or Agencies or sub-committees of the Assembly or the staffs thereof are not eligible to serve on any of these committees of commissioners. For the purpose of defining those ineligible for service in committees of commissioners, permanent Committee or Agency “staff” is to be understood as persons required to be examined by the Theological Examining Committee (<i>BCO</i> 14-1.12.) and all permanent Committee and Agency support personnel. All commissioners should bear in mind <i>Robert’s Rules of Order</i> regarding abstaining from voting on a question of direct personal interest (RONR (12th ed.) 45:4-5).</p>
<p class="p1"><b>14-3.</b> Minutes of the permanent Committee or Agency shall be submitted to the committee of commissioners for review. Copies of the minutes shall be sent by the Stated Clerk to the members of committees of commissioners one month prior to the opening of the General Assembly.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>14-6.</b> The committees of commissioners shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 40px;">a. At the proper time each committee shall assemble in its assigned room, elect a chairman and a secretary, review material in hand, appoint sub-committees as may be necessary, and begin its work. <span class="s3">Before the work of the committee begins, the committee of commissioners</span> chairman shall call on the Coordinator or Chairman of the permanent Committee or Agency or his designee to report on the work of that body and field questions or discussion from the committee of commissioners.</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 40px;">b. Each committee shall be available to reconvene to consider additional references that may come from the floor of the Assembly.</p>

<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 40px;">f. After a committee of commissioners has received input from the permanent Committee, coordinator, staff members, and visitors, it should then go into executive session as it frames and adopts its report to the General Assembly. It must be in executive session when it actually adopts the report.</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 40px;">g. When necessary for the performance of its <span class="s4">duties, a committee of commissioners may, by a majority of those present and voting</span>, invite other persons to address the committee.</p>

The printed substitute recommendation must be presented to the chairman of the permanent Committee or Agency as soon as practicable, but in no case less than fifteen (15) minutes before the recommendation in question is brought to the floor.</p>

<h2 class="p1">ARTICLE XVI. </h2>
<h4 class="p1"><em>REVIEW OF PRESBYTERY RECORDS</em></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>16-1. </b>It is the right and duty of the General Assembly to review, at least once a year, the records of the Presbyteries of the Presbyterian Church in America (<i>BCO</i> 40-1 and 2).</p>
<p class="p1"><b>16-2</b>. General Assembly carries out this review through its Committee on Review of Presbytery Records. The operation of this committee shall be considered a General Assembly expense.</p>
<p class="p21"><b>16-3. Guidelines for Keeping Presbytery Minutes</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 40px;">a. The stated clerk of each Presbytery is responsible for the custody of the minutes of Presbytery.</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 40px;">b. The minutes should be neat and legible. Minutes should be dated, and the pages numbered. An official copy of the minutes should be printed and either bound or kept in a good binder. Neither this official copy of the minutes nor any electronic copy submitted to the General Assembly for review may contain any material that must be accessed outside the documents submitted. This includes material that must be accessed through external links, websites, QR codes, file-sharing services, or other external digital platforms.</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 40px;">c. The minutes should contain the following information:</p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;">1) The kind of meeting: stated, called, adjourned stated, or adjourned called. In the case of a called meeting the portion of the call stating the purpose of the meeting should be recorded verbatim in the minutes.</p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;">2) The name of the Presbytery.</p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;">3) The date, time and place of the meeting.</p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;">4) The name of the moderator, and if someone other than the regular stated clerk served as a clerk pro-tem, his name should be indicated.</p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;">5) <span class="s3">That sessions were opened and closed with prayer (<i>BCO</i> 10-5).</span></p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;">6) The names of those present at the meeting, indicating whether they were teaching elders, or ruling elders and the church they represented. The names of alternate ruling elders and their respective churches should also be included, and the names of visitors may be included.</p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;">7) Teaching elders not attending and churches not represented should be listed as excused or unexcused.</p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;">8) Approval of current or previous minutes.</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 40px;">d. The minutes should be signed by the clerk.</p>
<p class="p7" style="padding-left: 40px;">e. Additional guidelines:</p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;">1) Points of order ruled against by the chair and appeals from the decision of the chair, whether sustained or lost, together with the reason given by the chair for his ruling, should be included for the sake of any case that may be carried to a higher court and for the protection of a minority. The record of the Presbytery’s actions should be recorded.</p>
<p class="p22" style="padding-left: 80px;">2) When a count has been ordered, or the vote is by ballot, the number of votes on each side should be entered.</p>
<p class="p23" style="padding-left: 80px;">3) The proceedings of a committee of the whole should not be entered in the minutes, but the fact that the assembly went into the committee as a whole. The committee report should be recorded.</p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;">4) When a commission is charged with carrying out a task prescribed in the Constitution (such as organizing a church or ordaining or installing a teaching elder), the minutes of P<span class="s9">resbytery should reflect the completion of each action prescribed</span> in the respective constitutional provision. This may be accomplished by reporting the work of the commission using <span class="s1">a form provided by the Stated Clerk of the General Assembly,</span> which should be included in or appended to the minutes.</p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;">5) Minutes of Presbytery relating to examinations must list all specific requirements and trials for licensure, ordination, and/or transfer which have been accomplished. This does not mean that a separate vote on each item must be recorded.</p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span class="s7">6) Minutes of Presbytery examinations for ordination (<em>BCO</em> 21-4) and/or transfer (<em>BCO</em> 13-6) must record that Presbytery accomplished the requirements of <em>BCO</em> 21-4.e. A statement such as “The examination in experiential religion (<em>BCO</em> 21-4.c.(1)(a)) covered all the items specified in section e of <em>BCO</em> 21-4” would be sufficient.</span></p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span class="s7">7) Minutes of Presbytery shall record</span> that each candidate being examined for <span class="s7">licensure,</span> ordination<span class="s7">, or transfer from another denomination</span> was required to “state the specific instances in which he may differ with the <i>Confession of Faith</i> and <i>Catechisms</i> in any of their statements and/or propositions” (<i>BCO</i> <span class="s7">13-6; </span>19-2; 21-4). Presbytery minutes shall record ministers’ and ministerial candidates’ stated differences with our Standards in their own words. Each presbytery shall also record whether:</p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 120px;">a)the candidate stated that he had no differences; or</p>
<p class="p13" style="padding-left: 120px;">b)the court judged the stated difference(s) to be merely semantic; or</p>
<p class="p13" style="padding-left: 120px;">c)the court judged the stated difference(s) to be more than semantic, but “not out of accord with any fundamental of our system of doctrine” (<i>BCO</i> 19-2; 21-4); or</p>
<p class="p13" style="padding-left: 120px;">d) the court judged the stated difference(s) to be “out of accord,” that is, “hostile to the system” or “strik[ing] at the vitals of religion” (BCO 19-2; 21-4).</p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span class="s7">8</span>) Minutes of Presbytery relating to ministerial calls shall record that the specific arrangements (<i>BCO</i> 20-1, and <i>BCO</i> 8-7 as applicable) of the call were found to be in order. The call document need not be attached to the minutes.</p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;">9) Minutes of executive sessions are not exempt from the general requirement that presbytery’s actions shall be recorded in the Presbytery’s minutes and that these minutes (even if kept in a separate section on executive sessions) shall be submitted to the General Assembly for review (BCO 13-11; 14-6.c; 40-1). Presbytery may ask that the Committee on Review of Presbytery Records deal with these minutes confidentially. However, any exceptions to these minutes must be submitted to the General Assembly through the normal procedures.</p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span class="s7">10</span>) Minutes of Presbytery dealing with judicial cases shall not be dealt with by Committee on Review of Presbytery Records when notice of appeal or complaint has been given the lower court (<i>BCO</i> 40-3). Nevertheless, minutes of judicial cases must always be submitted as part of the record of Presbytery.</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 40px;">f. The following suggestions are made to clerks and Presbyteries for the keeping of minutes:</p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;">1) The minutes should record the actions of the Presbytery, including all motions adopted and business transacted, together with such additional information as the Presbytery deems desirable for historical purposes.</p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;">2) Ordinarily in church courts, motions that are lost are not included in the record, unless an affirmative vote for the lost <span class="s2">motion is recorded, in which case the lost motion must be shown.</span></p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;">3) Each main motion should normally be recorded in a separate <span class="s3">paragraph. Subsidiary and procedural motions may be recorded</span> <span class="s3">in the same paragraph with the main motion to which it pertains.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><b>16-4. Guidelines for Submitting of Presbytery Records:</b></p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 40px;">a. The stated clerk of each Presbytery is to provide the Stated Clerk <span class="s1">of the General Assembly with copies of all minutes to be reviewed,</span> in one of two formats: (1) four bound, paginated hard-copies or (2) two bound, paginated hard-copies and one paginated<i> </i>digital copy (preferably as a single document).</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 40px;">b. The minutes to be reviewed shall include the unreviewed minutes of all Presbytery meetings that have been held through the end of the previous calendar year (<i>BCO</i> 40-1).</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 40px;">c. In addition to the minutes themselves, the Presbytery shall submit a corresponding number of copies, in accordance with 16-4.a, of the following items:</p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;">1) A current Directory of Presbytery, including (1) a list of all teaching elders, with their addresses and their status; and of all churches and missions with the address of the church, and the name and <span class="s1">address of the Clerk of Session, (2) a listing of all officers and </span>committee members of the regular committees of Presbytery, and (3) a list identifying all candidates under care, interns, and licentiates of the Presbytery with their addresses and their status.</p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;">2) An up-to-date copy of the Standing Rules of the Presbytery.</p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;">3) A letter stating Presbytery’s response to the Assembly concerning disposition of any exceptions of substance taken by the past Assembly.</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 40px;">d. The minutes are to be reviewed and the items listed under 16-4.c shall be mailed to the office of the Stated Clerk of the General Assembly by March 15 each year.</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 40px;">e. If a Presbytery repeatedly fails to submit its minutes, or its responses to exceptions of substance, the Committee on Review of Presbytery Records may recommend to the General Assembly that the provisions of <i>BCO</i> 40-1, 4, &amp; 5 be applied.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>16-5</b>. The stated clerk of each Presbytery, or his representative, should be prepared to meet with the committee to answer questions and to clarify any possible discrepancy. The committee should make every reasonable effort to consult with the clerk of the Presbytery (or his designee) on any questions before finalizing the report to the General Assembly.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>16-6. Guidelines for Examining Presbytery Records:</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 40px;">a. Presbytery minutes shall be examined for conformity to:</p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;">1) The Scriptures and the Constitution of the Presbyterian Church in America as to the substance of the actions recorded (<i>BCO</i> 40-2), and</p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;">2) The Assembly Guidelines for Keeping Presbytery Minutes, as to form, structure, and minimum content (<i>RAO</i> 16-3).</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 40px;">b. Each set of {resbytery minutes and other materials submitted under <i>RAO</i> 16-4c should be read by at least two members of the Committee on Review of Presbytery Records.</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">c. The findings of the committee with respect to the minutes of each Presbytery shall be noted under the following categories as appropriate:</span></p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;">1) Exceptions of substance: Apparent violations of the Scripture or serious irregularities from the Constitution of the Presbyterian Church in America, actions out of accord with the deliverances of the General Assembly, and matters of impropriety and important delinquencies, and any non-compliance with <em>RAO</em> 16-3.e.5-7 should be reported under this category.</p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;">2) Exceptions of form: Violations of the Assembly&#8217;s Guidelines for Keeping Presbytery Minutes (<i>RAO</i> 16-3), rules of order, etc. should normally be reported under this category. When a minor irregularity from a <i>BCO</i> provision or requirement is noted, it may be treated as an exception of form (<i>BCO</i> 40-3). If subsequent minutes continue to reflect the same particular exception of form, it may become an exception of substance.</p>
<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;">3) Notations: The committee may report to the clerk of presbytery any typographical errors, misspellings, improper punctuation and other minor variations in form and clarity. These are to be given as advice for the respective clerks.</p>

<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;">3) Minutes approved with exceptions of substance which shall be presented to the General Assembly, which presentation shall include citation of any relevant scriptural and/or constitutional references, and provide the committee’s rationale for finding the exception of substance;</p>

<p class="p12" style="padding-left: 80px;">2) Presbytery respectfully disagrees with the exception, states its grounds and refers the exception back to the Assembly.</p>
<p class="p8" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s4">c. </span><span class="s1">If, in responding to an exception of substance, a Presbytery reports that it disagrees with the conclusion of the Assembly and/or has</span> not corrected or redressed the identified problem; and, the committee (after reviewing the Presbytery’s response and rationale, and, if a majority so desires, consulting with the Committee on Constitutional Business) continues to believe that the Presbytery has persisted in an error that is significant enough to require an Assembly response; then, the committee shall notify the Assembly of the continuing exception, and shall make recommendation as to whether the Assembly should again seek a more acceptable response from the Presbytery, or should appoint a representative to present its case and refer the matter to the Standing Judicial Commission to cite the Presbytery to appear for proceedings according to <i>BCO</i> 40-5.</p>
<p><strong>16-11.</strong> During a meeting of the Committee on Review of Presbytery Records, a motion to <em>Limit or Extend Limits of Debate</em> shall not be permitted, but there shall be permitted a motion to order the <em>Previous Question</em>, which motion shall be adopted upon three-quarters (3/4) of the members present and voting.</p>

<h4 class="p8"><em> STANDING JUDICIAL COMMISSION</em></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>17-1. </b>There shall be a Standing Judicial Commission composed of twenty-four members in accordance with <i>BCO</i> 15-4. Upon election, each new member of the Standing Judicial Commission, before entering upon the duties of this office, shall sign a printed copy of the following vows; further, if the newly elected member is present, he shall affirm these vows in the presence of the Assembly electing him:</p>
<p class="p40" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b> “I do solemnly vow, by the assistance of the grace of God, in my service as a judge in this branch of the church of our lord Jesus Christ, that</b></p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 80px;"><b>1. I will act as before God, my Judge and the Searcher of hearts;</b></p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 80px;"><b>2. I will judge without respect to persons, and if so tempted, will recuse myself from judgment;</b></p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 80px;"><b>3. I will judge not according to appearances, but judge righteous judgment;</b></p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 80px;"><b>4. I will judge according to the Constitution of the Presbyterian Church in America, through my best efforts applied to nothing other than the record of the case and other documents properly before me; and</b></p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 80px;"><b>5. If in a given case I find my view on a particular issue to be in conflict with the Constitution of the Presbyterian Church in America, I will recuse myself from such case, if I cannot conscientiously apply the Constitution.”</b></p>
<p class="p1">The Standing Judicial Commission<b> </b>shall have oversight of appeals, complaints and judicial references from lower courts. The Standing Judicial Commission will report directly to the General Assembly.</p>
<p class="p1">The Standing Judicial Commission shall not be separately funded but administratively will operate as a subcommittee of the Administrative Committee of General Assembly.</p>
<p class="p1">The minutes, but not the judicial cases, decisions, or reports, of the Standing Judicial Commission shall be reviewed annually by the Committee on Constitutional Business. The minutes shall be examined for conformity to the <em>Operating Manual for Standing Judicial Commission</em> and <i>RAO</i> 17, violations of which shall be reported as “exceptions” as defined in <i>RAO</i> 14-11.d.(2). With respect to this examination, the Committee on Constitutional Business shall report directly to the General Assembly. If exceptions are taken with respect to a case, the Assembly may find this a ground to direct the Standing Judicial Commission to retry the case.</p>
<p class="p14"><span class="s4"><b>17-2.</b> With respect to the Rules of Discipline, any</span> reference (<i>BCO</i> 41), appeal (<i>BCO</i> 42), complaint (<i>BCO</i> 43), <i>BCO</i> 40-5 proceeding, or request to assume original jurisdiction (<i>BCO</i> 34-1) made to the General Assembly shall be assigned to the Standing Judicial Commission for adjudication.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>17-3.</b> The Standing Judicial Commission may appoint a judicial panel of not less than five of its members to hear the case in accordance with the provisions of the Rules of Discipline and these <em>Rules of Assembly Operations</em>. Such panels shall be chosen as follows:</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 40px;">a. A pool with the names of Standing Judicial Commission members shall be established shall be established. The chairman of the Standing Judicial Commission shall draw by lot names of panel members until he reaches a combination of three teaching elders and two ruling elders, or vice versa. The chairman shall notify the Stated Clerk of the General Assembly, who shall notify, immediately, those so chosen.</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 40px;">b. <span class="s1">If a </span>panel member so selected shall be disqualified under Section 2 of the <em>Operating Manual for Standing Judicial Commission</em>, he shall be replaced by another from the same class drawn from the pool.</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 40px;">c. The names of those panel members selected and qualified shall not be returned to the pool until all names therein have been exhausted. The names of those members whose terms expire at the next General Assembly shall be withdrawn from the pool on May 1 of that year.</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 40px;">d. Immediately after each General Assembly the name of each new member selected at such General Assembly shall be added to the pool.</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 40px;">e. If a case is pending and a judicial panel has been appointed as set out above, and another case is filed from the same presbytery, the officers of the commission may elect to assign the second case to the same panel without resort to the pools. The officers of the commission may assign the additional case or cases to the same panel without resort to the pools only if: (1) the facts of the cases are so interconnected that assignment to different panels reasonably appears to require repetitious consideration of the same factual circumstances; or (2) assignment of unrelated cases to the same panel is agreed to by all parties to all of the cases.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>17-4.</b> Proposed decision(s) of any judicial panel shall be circulated to the entire Standing Judicial Commission. It shall act upon the recommended <span class="s1">decision(s) without further hearings unless a party to the case, or a commission member, requests a rehearing of the case by the Standing Judicial Commission </span>as a whole. The commission may or may not grant such a rehearing; except such rehearing must be granted when requested by a voting member of the panel or by at least seven qualified members of the commission. If granted, such rehearing shall be only on the record of the case; but the commission may allow oral arguments by the parties.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>17-5. </b>The Standing Judicial Commission shall be governed by the provisions of the Constitution of the Presbyterian Church in America and the <i>Rules of Assembly Operations</i>. Specific directions governing the implementation of these provisions shall be set forth in an <i>Operating Manual for Standing Judicial Commission</i>, as adopted by the General Assembly. Amendments to this Manual may be proposed to the General Assembly by overture from a presbytery (cf. Article XI), or by recommendation from the Standing Judicial Commission. Proposed amendments from either source shall be reported to the Assembly by the Standing Judicial Commission, and shall be adopted upon a two-thirds vote of those voting, which must be a majority of the total enrollment of commissioners. This Manual shall be printed as an appendix to the <i>Rules of Assembly Operations</i>.</p>

<h4 class="p1"><em>Parliamentary Procedure</em><b></b></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>19-1.</b> Except as otherwise specifically provided in these Rules, <i>Robert’s Rules of Order</i>, <em>Newly Revised</em>, shall be the standard in parliamentary procedure.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>19-2.</b> Each chairman shall lead the Assembly in a brief prayer before making his report.</p>
<p class="p1">When a minority of a committee wishes to present a minority report, the member reporting for the minority shall have the privilege of presenting the minority report and moving it as a substitute for the portion of the majority report affected.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>19-3.</b> Each recommendation in each report must be read, considered, and acted upon separately.</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 40px;">a. The chairman moves the adoption; no second is necessary for a committee recommendation.</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 40px;">b. The Moderator asks: “Is there objection or question?”</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 40px;">c. Hearing no objection or question, the Moderator states: “It is adopted.” (The above procedure is known as the “Short Form of Voting.”)</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 40px;">d. When it is necessary to postpone action on the completion of a report for some subsequent action of the Assembly, such as the approval of the budgets, or other special items, the report shall be approved as a whole pending the completion of these other items. At the time that the other items come to the floor, only these matters may be considered by the Assembly, since the report as a whole will have already been adopted.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>19-4. Procedure in debating a question</b>:</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 40px;">a. The chairman or his designate may answer questions concerning the report addressed to him through the Moderator.</p>
<p class="p8" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s4">b. </span>With respect to any recommendation, the representative of any Committee or Agency shall have the right to make the final speech in support of the Committee’s motion before the question is put on a substitute, or on the Committee or Agency’s main motion, as the case may be, even upon the expiration of time on the question, the failure of a motion to extend the time, or the adoption of a motion to order the <i>Previous Question</i>.</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 40px;">c. No commissioner may speak on the same question more than once until all desiring to speak have done so.</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 40px;">d. Unless otherwise provided, debate on the main motion shall be <span class="s1">limited to ten (10) minutes unless extended. When a main motion</span> has been debated for ten (10) minutes, the Moderator shall put the question to the Assembly: “Does the Assembly desire to extend the time an additional five (5) minutes?” A simple majority will decide the question. If the majority decides not to extend debate, the Moderator will call the question. If an amendment of a substitution is on the floor, the question of extending time on the main motion shall be repeated after the vote on the amendment or substitute. If time is extended, the question of extension will again be put every succeeding five (5) <span class="s1">minutes until the motion is concluded. Unless otherwise provided,</span> each commissioner shall be limited to three (3) minutes on the same question unless the court by a simple majority grants additional time.</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 40px;">e. Debate shall be free and open, with equal time being given to proponents and opponents insofar as possible.</p>
