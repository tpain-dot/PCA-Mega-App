<h2>CHAPTER FIFTY</h2>
<h4 class="p1"><i>The Public Reading of the Holy Scriptures</i><i></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>50-1</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The public reading of the Holy Scriptures is performed by the minister as God’s servant. Through it God speaks most directly to the congregation, even more directly than through the sermon. The reading of the Scriptures by the minister is to be distinguished from the responsive reading of certain portions of Scripture by the minister and the congregation. In the former God addresses His people; in the latter God’s people give expression in the words of Scripture to their contrition, adoration, gratitude and other holy sentiments. The psalms of Scripture are especially appropriate for responsive reading.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>50-2</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The reading of the Holy Scriptures in the congregation is a part of the public worship of God and should be done by the minister or some other person.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>50-3</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments shall be read from a good translation, not a paraphrase, in the language of the people, that all may hear and understand.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>50-4</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>How large a portion shall be read at once is left to the discretion of every minister; and he may, when he thinks it expedient, expound any part of what is read; always having regard to the time, that neither reading, singing, praying, preaching, nor any other ordinance, be disproportionate the one to the other; nor the whole rendered too short, or too tedious.</p>
