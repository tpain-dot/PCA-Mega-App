<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</h2>
<h4 class="p1"><i>Offenses</i><i></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>29-1</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>An offense, the proper object of judicial process, is anything in the doctrines or practice of a Church member professing faith in Christ which is contrary to the Word of God. The <i>Confession of Faith</i> and the <i>Larger</i> and <i>Shorter Catechisms</i> of the Westminster Assembly, together with the formularies of government, discipline, and worship are accepted by the Presbyterian Church in America as standard expositions of the teachings of Scripture in relation to both faith and practice. Nothing, therefore, ought to be considered by any court as an offense, or admitted as a matter of accusation, which cannot be proved to be such from Scripture.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>29-3</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Personal offenses are violations of the divine law, considered in the special relation of wrongs or injuries to particular individuals. General offenses are heresies or immoralities having no such relation, or considered apart from it.</p>
