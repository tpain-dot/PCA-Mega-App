<p class="p1"><b>Q. 161.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>How do the sacraments become effectual means of salvation?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The sacraments become effectual means of salvation, not by any power in themselves, or any virtue derived from the piety or intention of him by whom they are administered, but only by the working of the Holy Ghost, and the blessing of Christ, by whom they are instituted.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 162.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>What is a sacrament?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>A sacrament is an holy ordinance instituted by Christ in his church, to signify, seal, and exhibit unto those that are within the covenant of grace, the benefits of his mediation; to strengthen and increase their faith, and all other graces; to oblige them to obedience; to testify and cherish their love and communion one with another; and to distinguish them from those that are without.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 163.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>What are the parts of a sacrament?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The parts of a sacrament are two; the one an outward and sensible sign, used according to Christ’s own appointment; the other an inward and spiritual grace thereby signified.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 164.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>How many sacraments hath Christ instituted in his church under the new testament?</p>

<p class="p1"><b>Q. 165.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>What is baptism?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Baptism is a sacrament of the new testament, wherein Christ hath ordained the washing with water in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, to be a sign and seal of ingrafting into himself, of remission of sins by his blood, and regeneration by his Spirit; of adoption, and resurrection unto everlasting life; and whereby the parties baptized are solemnly admitted into the visible church, and enter into an open and professed engagement to be wholly and only the Lord’s.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 166.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Unto whom is baptism to be administered?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Baptism is not to be administered to any that are out of the visible church, and so strangers from the covenant of promise, till they profess their faith in Christ, and obedience to him, but infants descending from parents, either both, or but one of them, professing faith in Christ, and obedience to him, are in that respect within the covenant, and to be baptized.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 167.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>How is our baptism to be improved by us?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The needful but much neglected duty of improving our baptism, is to be performed by us all our life long, especially in the time of temptation, and when we are present at the administration of it to others; by serious and thankful consideration of the nature of it, and of the ends for which Christ instituted it, the privileges and benefits conferred and sealed thereby, and our solemn vow made therein; by being humbled for our sinful defilement, our falling short of, and walking contrary to, the grace of baptism, and our engagements; by growing up to assurance of pardon of sin, and of all other blessings sealed to us in that sacrament; by drawing strength from the death and resurrection of Christ, into whom we are baptized, for the mortifying of sin, and quickening of grace; and by endeavoring to live by faith, to have our conversation in holiness and righteousness, as those that have therein given up their names to Christ; and to walk in brotherly love, as being baptized by the same Spirit into one body.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 168.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>What is the Lord’s Supper?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The Lord’s Supper is a sacrament of the new testament, wherein, by giving and receiving bread and wine according to the appointment of Jesus Christ, his death is showed forth; and they that worthily communicate feed upon his body and blood, to their spiritual nourishment and growth in grace; have their union and communion with him confirmed; testify and renew their thankfulness, and engagement to God, and their mutual love and fellowship each with other, as members of the same mystical body.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 169.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>How hath Christ appointed bread and wine to be given and received in the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Christ hath appointed the ministers of his Word, in the administration of this sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, to set apart the bread and wine from common use, by the word of institution, thanksgiving, and prayer; to take and break the bread, and to give both the bread and the wine to the communicants: who are, by the same appointment, to take and eat the bread, and to drink the wine, in thankful remembrance that the body of Christ was broken and given, and his blood shed, for them.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 170.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>How do they that worthily communicate in the Lord’s supper feed upon the body and blood of Christ therein?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>As the body and blood of Christ are not corporally or carnally present in, with, or under the bread and wine in the Lord’s Supper, and yet are spiritually present to the faith of the receiver, no less truly and really than the elements themselves are to their outward senses; so they that worthily communicate in the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, do therein feed upon the body and blood of Christ, not after a corporal and carnal, but in a spiritual manner; yet truly and really, while by faith they receive and apply unto themselves Christ crucified, and all the benefits of his death.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 171.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>How are they that receive the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper to prepare themselves before they come unto it?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>They that receive the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper are, before they come, to prepare themselves thereunto, by examining themselves of their being in Christ, of their sins and wants; of the truth and measure of their knowledge, faith, repentance; love to God and the brethren, charity to all men, forgiving those that have done them wrong; of their desires after Christ, and of their new obedience; and by renewing the exercise of these graces, by serious meditation, and fervent prayer.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 172.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>May one who doubteth of his being in Christ, or of his due preparation, come to the Lord’s Supper?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>One who doubteth of his being in Christ, or of his due preparation to the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, may have true interest in Christ, though he be not yet assured thereof; and in God’s account hath it, if he be duly affected with the apprehension of the want of it, and unfeignedly desires to be found in Christ, and to depart from iniquity: in which case (because promises are made, and this sacrament is appointed, for the relief even of weak and doubting Christians) he is to bewail his unbelief, and labor to have his doubts resolved; and, so doing, he may and ought to come to the Lord’s Supper, that he may be further strengthened.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 173.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>May any who profess the faith, and desire to come to the Lord’s Supper, be kept from it?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Such as are found to be ignorant or scandalous, notwithstanding their profession of the faith, and desire to come to the Lord’s Supper, may and ought to be kept from that sacrament, by the power which Christ hath left in his church, until they receive instruction, and manifest their reformation.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 174.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>What is required of them that receive the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper in the time of the administration of it?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>It is required of them that receive the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, that, during the time of the administration of it, with all holy reverence and attention they wait upon God in that ordinance, diligently observe the sacramental elements and actions, heedfully discern the Lord’s body, and affectionately meditate on his death and sufferings, and thereby stir up themselves to a vigorous exercise of their graces; in judging themselves, and sorrowing for sin; in earnest hungering and thirsting after Christ, feeding on him by faith, receiving of his fullness, trusting in his merits, rejoicing in his love, giving thanks for his grace; in renewing of their covenant with God, and love to all the saints.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 175.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>What is the duty of Christians, after they have received the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The duty of Christians, after they have received the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, is seriously to consider how they have behaved themselves therein, and with what success; if they find quickening and comfort, to bless God for it, beg the continuance of it, watch against relapses, fulfill their vows, and encourage themselves to a frequent attendance on that ordinance: but if they find no present benefit, more exactly to review their preparation to, and carriage at, the sacrament; in both which, if they can approve themselves to God and their own consciences, they are to wait for the fruit of it in due time: but, if they see they have failed in either, they are to be humbled, and to attend upon it afterwards with more care and diligence.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 176.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Wherein do the sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s Supper agree?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s Supper agree, in that the author of both is God; the spiritual part of both is Christ and his benefits; both are seals of the same covenant, are to be dispensed by ministers of the gospel, and by none other; and to be continued in the church of Christ until his second coming.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 177.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Wherein do the sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s Supper differ?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s Supper differ, in that baptism is to be administered but once, with water, to be a sign and seal of our regeneration and ingrafting into Christ, and that even to infants; whereas the Lord’s Supper is to be administered often, in the elements of bread and wine, to represent and exhibit Christ as spiritual nourishment to the soul, and to confirm our continuance and growth in him, and that only to such as are of years and ability to examine themselves.</p>
