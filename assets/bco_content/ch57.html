<h2>CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVEN</h2>
<h4 class="p1"><i>The Admission of Persons to Sealing Ordinances</i><i></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>57-1</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Believers’ children within the Visible Church, and especially those dedicated to God in Baptism, are non-communing members under the care of the Church. They are to be taught to love God, and to obey and serve the Lord Jesus Christ. When they are able to understand the Gospel, they should be earnestly reminded that they are members of the Church by birthright, and that it is their duty and privilege personally to accept Christ, to confess Him before men, and to seek admission to the Lord’s Supper.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>57-2</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The time when young persons come to understand the Gospel cannot be precisely fixed. This must be left to the prudence of the Session, whose office it is to judge, after careful examination, the qualifications of those who apply for admission to sealing ordinances.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>57-3</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>When unbaptized persons apply for admission into the Church, they shall, ordinarily, after giving satisfaction with respect to their knowledge and piety, make a public profession of their faith, in the presence of the congregation, and thereupon be baptized.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>57-4</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>It is recommended, as edifying and proper, that baptized persons, when admitted by the Session to the Lord’s Supper, make a public profession of their faith in the presence of the congregation. But in all cases, there should be a clear recognition of their previous relation to the church as baptized members.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>57-5</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The time having come for the making of a public profession, and those who have been approved by the Session having taken their places in the presence of the congregation, the minister may state that:</p>
<p class="p3">
<p class="p4" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Of the number of those who were baptized in infancy as members of the Church of God by birthright, and as heirs of the covenant promises, the Session has examined and approved (call them by name), who come now to assume for themselves the full privileges and responsibilities of their inheritance in the household of faith.</b><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p6">
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><span class="s2">If there be present any candidates for Baptism, the minister may state that:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"></span></p>
<p class="p4" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>As applicants for admission into the Church of God by Baptism, which is a sign and seal of our engrafting into Christ, and of our engagement to be the Lord’s, the Session has examined and approved (call them by name), who are cordially welcomed into the fellowship of the household of faith.</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The minister may then address those making a profession in the following terms:</p>
<p class="p3">
<p class="p4" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>(All of) you being here present to make a public profession of faith, are to assent to the following declarations and promises, by which you enter into a solemn covenant with God and His Church.</b></p>
<p class="p7" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b></b></p>
<p class="p8" style="padding-left: 80px;"><b>1.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Do you acknowledge yourselves to be sinners in the sight of God, justly deserving His displeasure, and without hope save in His sovereign mercy?</b></p>
<p class="p8" style="padding-left: 80px;"><b>2.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Do you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as the Son of God, and Savior of sinners, and do you receive and rest upon Him alone for salvation as He is offered in the Gospel?</b></p>
<p class="p8" style="padding-left: 80px;"><b>3.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Do you now resolve and promise, in humble reliance upon the grace of the Holy Spirit, that you will endeavor to live as becomes the followers of Christ?</b></p>
<p class="p8" style="padding-left: 80px;"><b>4.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Do you promise to support the Church in its worship and work to the best of your ability?</b></p>
<p class="p8" style="padding-left: 80px;"><b>5.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Do you submit yourselves to the government and discipline of the Church, and promise to study its purity and peace?</b></p>
<p class="p3"><b></b></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The minister may now briefly admonish those making a profession of faith as to the importance of the solemn obligations they have assumed; then baptism may be administered, if there be present any candidates for the ordinance, and the whole concluded with prayer.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>57-6</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Persons received from other churches by letters of dismissal as well as those being received by reaffirmation of faith should give a testimony of their Christian experience to the Session. Their names are to be announced to the congregation with a recommendation of them to its Christian confidence and affection.</p>
