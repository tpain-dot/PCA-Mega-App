<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>63-2</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Secret worship is most plainly enjoined by our Lord. In this duty everyone, apart, should spend some time in prayer, reading the Scriptures, holy meditation, and serious self-examination. The many advantages arising from a conscientious performance of these duties are best known to those who are found in the faithful discharge of them.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>63-3</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Family worship, which should be observed by every family, consists in prayer, reading the Scriptures, and singing praises; or in some briefer form of outspoken recognition of God.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>63-4</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Parents should instruct their children in the Word of God, and in the principles of our holy religion. The reading of devotional literature should be encouraged and every proper opportunity should be embraced for religious instruction.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>63-5</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Parents should set an example of piety and consistent living before the family. Unnecessary private visits on the Lord’s Day and indulgence in practices injurious to the spiritual life of the family, should be avoided.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>63-6</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>In the supreme task of religious education, parents should co-operate with the Church by setting their children an example in regular and punctual attendance upon the sessions of the church school and the services of the sanctuary, by assisting them in the preparation of their lessons, and by leading them in the consistent application of the teachings of the Gospel in their daily activities.</p>
