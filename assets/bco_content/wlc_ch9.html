<p class="p1"><b>Q. 76.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>What is repentance unto life?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Repentance unto life is a saving grace, wrought in the heart of a sinner by the Spirit and Word of God, whereby, out of the sight and sense, not only of the danger, but also of the filthiness and odiousness of his sins, and upon the apprehension of God’s mercy in Christ to such as are penitent, he so grieves for and hates his sins, as that he turns from them all to God, purposing and endeavoring constantly to walk with him in all the ways of new obedience.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 77.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Wherein do justification and sanctification differ?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Although sanctification be inseparably joined with justification, yet they differ, in that God in justification imputeth the righteousness of Christ; in sanctification his Spirit infuseth grace, and enableth to the exercise thereof; in the former, sin is pardoned; in the other, it is subdued: the one doth equally free all believers from the revenging wrath of God, and that perfectly in this life, that they never fall into condemnation; the other is neither equal in all, nor in this life perfect in any, but growing up to perfection.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 78.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Whence ariseth the imperfection of sanctification in believers?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The imperfection of sanctification in believers ariseth from the remnants of sin abiding in every part of them, and the perpetual lustings of the flesh against the spirit; whereby they are often foiled with temptations, and fall into many sins, are hindered in all their spiritual services, and their best works are imperfect and defiled in the sight of God.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 79.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>May not true believers, by reason of their imperfections, and the many temptations and sins they are overtaken with, fall away from the state of grace?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>True believers, by reason of the unchangeable love of God, and his decree and covenant to give them perseverance, their inseparable union with Christ, his continual intercession for them, and the Spirit and seed of God abiding in them, can neither totally nor finally fall away from the state of grace, but are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 80.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Can true believers be infallibly assured that they are in the estate of grace, and that they shall persevere therein unto salvation?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Such as truly believe in Christ, and endeavor to walk in all good conscience before him, may, without extraordinary revelation, by faith grounded upon the truth of God’s promises, and by the Spirit enabling them to discern in themselves those graces to which the promises of life are made, and bearing witness with their spirits that they are the children of God, be infallibly assured that they are in the estate of grace, and shall persevere therein unto salvation.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 81.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Are all true believers at all times assured of their present being in the estate of grace, and that they shall be saved?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Assurance of grace and salvation not being of the essence of faith, true believers may wait long before they obtain it; and, after the enjoyment thereof, may have it weakened and intermitted, through manifold distempers, sins, temptations, and desertions; yet are they never left without such a presence and support of the Spirit of God as keeps them from sinking into utter despair.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 82.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>What is the communion in glory which the members of the invisible church have with Christ?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The communion in glory which the members of the invisible church have with Christ, is in this life, immediately after death, and at last perfected at the resurrection and day of judgment.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 83.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>What is the communion in glory with Christ which the members of the invisible church enjoy in this life?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The members of the invisible church have communicated to them in this life the firstfruits of glory with Christ, as they are members of him their head, and so in him are interested in that glory which he is fully possessed of; and, as an earnest thereof, enjoy the sense of God’s love, peace of conscience, joy in the Holy Ghost, and hope of glory; as, on the contrary, sense of God’s revenging wrath, horror of conscience, and a fearful expectation of judgment, are to the wicked the beginning of their torments which they shall endure after death.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 84.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Shall all men die?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Death being threatened as the wages of sin, it is appointed unto all men once to die; for that all have sinned.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 85.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Death being the wages of sin, why are not the righteous delivered from death, seeing all their sins are forgiven in Christ?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The righteous shall be delivered from death itself at the last day, and even in death are delivered from the sting and curse of it; so that, although they die, yet it is out of God’s love, to free them perfectly from sin and misery, and to make them capable of further communion with Christ in glory, which they then enter upon.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 86.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>What is the communion in glory with Christ, which the members of the invisible church enjoy immediately after death?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The communion in glory with Christ, which the members of the invisible church enjoy immediately after death, is, in that their souls are then made perfect in holiness, and received into the highest heavens, where they behold the face of God in light and glory, waiting for the full redemption of their bodies, which even in death continue united to Christ, and rest in their graves as in their beds, till at the last day they be again united to their souls. Whereas the souls of the wicked are at their death cast into hell, where they remain in torments and utter darkness, and their bodies kept in their graves, as in their prisons, till the resurrection and judgment of the great day.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 87.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>What are we to believe concerning the resurrection?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>We are to believe, that at the last day there shall be a general resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust: when they that are then found alive shall in a moment be changed; and the selfsame bodies of the dead which were laid in the grave, being then again united to their souls forever, shall be raised up by the power of Christ. The bodies of the just, by the Spirit of Christ, and by virtue of his resurrection as their head, shall be raised in power, spiritual, incorruptible, and made like to his glorious body; and the bodies of the wicked shall be raised up in dishonor by him, as an offended judge.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 88.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>What shall immediately follow after the resurrection?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Immediately after the resurrection shall follow the general and final judgment of angels and men; the day and hour whereof no man knoweth, that all may watch and pray, and be ever ready for the coming of the Lord.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 89.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>What shall be done to the wicked at the day of judgment?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>At the day of judgment, the wicked shall be set on Christ’s left hand, and, upon clear evidence, and full conviction of their own consciences, shall have the fearful but just sentence of condemnation pronounced against them; and thereupon shall be cast out from the favorable presence of God, and the glorious fellowship with Christ, his saints, and all his holy angels, into hell, to be punished with unspeakable torments, both of body and soul, with the devil and his angels forever.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 90.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>What shall be done to the righteous at the day of judgment?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>At the day of judgment, the righteous, being caught up to Christ in the clouds, shall be set on his right hand, and there openly acknowledged and acquitted, shall join with him in the judging of reprobate angels and men, and shall be received into heaven, where they shall be fully and forever freed from all sin and misery; filled with inconceivable joys, made perfectly holy and happy both in body and soul, in the company of innumerable saints and holy angels, but especially in the immediate vision and fruition of God the Father, of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit, to all eternity. And this is the perfect and full communion, which the members of the invisible church shall enjoy with Christ in glory, at the resurrection and day of judgment.
