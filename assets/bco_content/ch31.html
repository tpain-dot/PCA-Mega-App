<h2>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</h2>
<h4 class="p1"><i>The Parties in Cases of Process</i><i></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>31-1</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Original jurisdiction (the right first or initially to hear and determine) in relation to ministers of the Gospel shall be in the Presbytery of which the minister is a member, except in cases as provided in <i>BCO</i> 34-1. Such original jurisdiction in relation to church members shall be in the Session of the church of which he/she is a member, except in cases as provided in <i>BCO</i> 33-1.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>31-2</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>It is the duty of all church Sessions and Presbyteries to exercise care over those subject to their authority. They shall with due diligence and great discretion demand from such persons satisfactory explanations concerning reports affecting their Christian character. This duty is more imperative when those who deem themselves aggrieved by injurious reports shall ask an investigation.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>If such investigation, however originating, should result in raising a strong presumption of the guilt of the party involved, the court shall institute process, and shall appoint a prosecutor to prepare the indictment and to conduct the case. This prosecutor shall be a member of the court, except that in a case before the Session, he may be any communing member of the same congregation with the accused.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>31-3</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The original and only parties in a case of process are the accuser and the accused. The accuser is always the Presbyterian Church in America, whose honor and purity are to be maintained. The prosecutor, whether voluntary or appointed, is always the representative of the Church, and as such has all its rights in the case. In appellate courts the parties are known as appellant and appellee.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>31-4</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Every indictment shall begin: <b>“In the name of the Presbyterian Church in America,”</b> and shall conclude, <b>“against the peace, unity and purity of the Church, and the honor and majesty of the Lord Jesus Christ, as the King and Head thereof.”</b> In every case the Church is the injured and accusing party, against the accused.</p>
<p class="p4">
<p class="p1"><b>31-5</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>An injured party shall not become a prosecutor of personal offenses without having tried the means of reconciliation and of reclaiming the offender, required by Christ.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>“Moreover, if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother but if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established” (Matthew 18:15-16).</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>A church court, however, may judicially investigate personal offenses as if general when the interest of religion seem to demand it. So, also, those to whom private offenses are known cannot become prosecutors without having previously endeavored to remove the scandal by private means.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>31-6</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>When the offense is general, the case may be conducted either by any person appearing as prosecutor or by a prosecutor appointed by the court.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>31-7</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>When the prosecution is instituted by the court, the previous steps required by our Lord in the case of personal offenses are not necessary. There are many cases, however, in which it will promote the interests of religion to send a committee to converse in a private manner with the offender, and endeavor to bring him to a sense of his guilt, before instituting actual process.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>31-8</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Great caution ought to be exercised in receiving accusations from any person who is known to indulge a malignant spirit towards the accused; who is not of good character; who is himself under censure or process; who is deeply interested in any respect in the conviction of the accused; or who is known to be litigious, rash or highly imprudent.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>31-9</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Every voluntary prosecutor shall be previously warned, that if he fail to show probable cause of the charges, he may himself be censured as a slanderer of the brethren.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>31-10</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span></span>When a member of a church court is under process, all his official functions may be suspended at the court’s discretion; but this shall never be done in the way of censure<span class="s3">, and this requires a two-thirds (2/3) majority.</span></p>
<p class="p5">
<p class="p1"><b>31-11</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>In the discussion of all questions arising in his own case, the accused shall exercise the rights of defendant only, not of judge.</p>
