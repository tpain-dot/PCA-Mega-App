<h2>CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE</h2>
<h4 class="p1"><i>The Preaching of the Word</i><i></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>53-1</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The preaching of the Word is an ordinance of God for the salvation of men. Serious attention should be paid to the manner in which it is done. The minister should apply himself to it with diligence and prove himself a “worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth” (2 Timothy 2:15).</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>53-2</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The subject of a sermon should be some verse or verses of Scripture, and its object, to explain, defend and apply some part of the system of divine truth; or to point out the nature, and state the bounds and obligation, of some duty. A text should not be merely a motto, but should fairly contain the doctrine proposed to be handled. It is proper also that large portions of Scripture be sometimes expounded, and particularly improved, for the instruction of the people in the meaning and use of the sacred Scriptures.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>53-3</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Preaching requires much study, meditation, and prayer, and ministers should prepare their sermons with care, and not indulge themselves in loose, extemporary harangues, nor serve God with that which costs them naught. They should, however, keep to the simplicity of the Gospel, and express themselves in language that can be understood by all. They should also by their lives adorn the Gospel which they preach, and be examples to believers in word and deed.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>53-4</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>As a primary design of public ordinances is to unite the people in acts of common worship of the most high God, ministers should be careful not to make their sermons so long as to interfere with or exclude the important duties of prayer and praise, but should preserve a just proportion in the several parts of public worship.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>53-5</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>By way of application of the sermon the minister may urge his hearers by commandment or invitation to repent of their sins, to put their trust in the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior, and to confess him publicly before men.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>53-6</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>No person should be invited to preach in any of the churches under our care without the consent of the Session.</p>
