<h2>CHAPTER TWELVE</h2>
<h4 class="p1"><i>The Church Session</i><i></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>12-1.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The church Session consists of the pastor, associate pastor(s), if there be any, and the ruling elders of a church. If there are four or more ruling elders, the pastor and two ruling elders shall constitute a quorum. If there are fewer than four ruling elders, the pastor and one ruling elder shall constitute a quorum. Assistant pastors, although not members of the Session, may be invited to attend and participate in discussion without vote.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>When a church has no pastor and there are five or more ruling elders, three shall constitute a quorum; if there are less than five ruling elders, two shall constitute a quorum; if there is only one ruling elder, he does not constitute a Session, but he should take spiritual oversight of the church, should represent it at Presbytery, should grant letters of dismission, and should report to the Presbytery any matter needing the action of a Church court.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Any Session, by a majority vote of its members, may fix its own quorum, provided that it is not smaller than the quorum stated in these paragraphs.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>12-2</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The pastor is, by virtue of his office, the moderator of the Session. In the pastor’s absence, if any emergency should arise requiring immediate action, the Session may elect one of its members to preside, the quorum for such emergency meeting being as in the case of a church with no pastor in 12-1. Should prudential reasons at any time make it advisable for a minister other than the pastor to preside, the pastor may, with the concurrence of the Session, invite a minister of the same Presbytery to perform this service.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>12-3</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>When a church is without a pastor, the moderator of the Session may be either a minister appointed for that purpose by the Presbytery, with consent of the Session, or one invited by the Session to preside on a particular occasion, or one of its own members elected to preside. In judicial cases, the moderator shall be a minister of the Presbytery to which the church belongs.</p>
