<h2>CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</h2>
<h4 class="p1"><i>Special Rules Pertaining to Process Before Sessions</i><i></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>33-1.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Process against all church members, other than ministers of the Gospel, shall be entered before the Session of the church to which such members belong, except in cases of appeal. However, if the Session refuses to act in doctrinal cases or instances of public scandal and two other Sessions of churches in the same Presbytery request the Presbytery of which the church is a member to initiate proper or appropriate action in a case of process and thus assume jurisdiction and authority, the Presbytery shall do so.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>33-2.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>When an accused person is found contumacious (cf. 32-6), he shall be immediately suspended from the sacraments (and if an officer from his office) for his contumacy. Record shall be made of the fact and of the charges under which he was arraigned, and the censure may be made public, should this be deemed expedient by the Session. The censure shall in no case be removed until the offender has not only repented of his contumacy, but has also given satisfaction in relation to the charges against him.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>33-3.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>If after further endeavor by the court to bring the accused to a sense of his guilt, he persists in his contumacy, he shall be excommunicated from the Church.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>33-4</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>When it is impracticable immediately to commence process against an accused church member, the Session may, if it thinks the edification of the Church requires it, prevent the accused from approaching the Lord’s Table until the charges against him can be examined<span class="s1">, but this requires a two-thirds (2/3) majority.</span></p>
