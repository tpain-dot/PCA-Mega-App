<h4 class="p1"><i>The General Assembly</i><i></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>14-1.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The General Assembly is the highest court of this Church, and represents in one body all the churches thereof. It bears the title of The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in America, and constitutes the bond of union, peace and correspondence among all its congregations and courts.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;">Principles for the Organization of the Assembly:</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;">1.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The Church is responsible for carrying out the Great Commission.</p>
<p class="p4" style="padding-left: 40px;">2.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The initiative for carrying out the Great Commission belongs to the Church at every court level, and the Assembly is responsible to encourage and promote the fulfillment of this ministry by the various courts.</p>
<p class="p4" style="padding-left: 40px;">3.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The work of the Church as set forth in the Great Commission is one work, being implemented at the General Assembly level through equally essential committees.</p>
<p class="p4" style="padding-left: 40px;">4.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>It is the responsibility of every member and every member congregation to support the whole work of the denomination as they be led in their conscience held captive to the Word of God.</p>
<p class="p4" style="padding-left: 40px;">5.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>It is the responsibility of the General Assembly to evaluate needs and resources, and to act on priorities for the most effective fulfillment of the Great Commission.</p>
<p class="p4" style="padding-left: 40px;">6.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The Church recognizes the right of individuals and congregations to labor through other agencies in fulfilling the Great Commission.</p>
<p class="p4" style="padding-left: 40px;">7.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The Assembly&#8217;s committees are to serve and not to direct any Church judicatories. They are not to establish policy, but rather execute policy established by the General Assembly.</p>
<p class="p4" style="padding-left: 40px;">8.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The committees serve the Church through the duties assigned by the General Assembly.</p>

Each alternate should attend each meeting and fill any vacancy necessary to meet a quorum. In addition to the new nominees from the Presbyteries, alternates not assuming any vacancies during a year will be automatically considered by the Nominating Committee as candidates for nomination to that same committee.</p>
