<h2 class="p3">APPENDIX H</h2>
<h4 class="p3"><em>SUGGESTED PROCEDURES FOR PRESBYTERY JUDICIAL COMMISSIONS ACTING AS APPELLATE COURTS </em></h4>
<p class="p5">1. These procedures are suggested when a Presbytery, as an appellate court, decides that an appeal or complaint arising from a Session is in order, and in accordance with <i>BCO</i> 15, chooses to appoint a Judicial Commission to hear the case. The Presbytery Stated Clerk shall promptly notify the parties of the names of the Commission members and the initial contact information. (See flowchart.)</p>
<p class="p5">2. A hearing shall not be conducted until the Commission determines that the Record of the Case is complete (perfected), the parties have had opportunity to file briefs, and the members of the Commission have had adequate time to read the Record and all briefs.</p>
<p class="p1">3. The convener or chairman of the Commission shall convene the first meeting within 10 days of the Presbytery meeting at which the Commission was appointed. This meeting may be held the same day Presbytery appoints the Commission. At this convening meeting the Commission shall elect its chairman and secretary, unless Presbytery had previously appointed them. In addition to other preliminary matters, the Commission may discuss potential dates for a hearing and the current status of the Record. The chairman shall promptly notify the parties of all addresses necessary for filing purposes.</p>
<p class="p5">4. Conference calls are acceptable for all Commission meetings other than the hearing. This includes the meetings to: 1) convene the Commission, 2) resolve disputes on the Record, 3) adopt a Judgment, and 4) adopt a written decision and approve minutes.</p>
<p class="p5">5. At its discretion and with the consent of both parties, the Commission may decide to accept email, fax or similar means for filings after establishing procedures to confirm the date that a document is filed and received.</p>
<p class="p1">6. <span class="s7">Record of the Case – After the Commission is appointed, the Presbytery Stated Clerk shall</span> <span class="s7">promptly ensure delivery of the Record to each Commission </span><span class="s6">member and to all parties to the case. It shall be delivered to the appellant/</span><span class="s7"> complainant in person or in some other manner providing verification of the date of </span><span class="s6">receipt. If the appellant/complainant believes </span><span class="s5">the Record is</span> <span class="s4">incomplete or incorrect, </span>he shall, within 14 days of receiving such Record, file written notice with the Commission and with the Session (clerk or respondent). Such notice shall specify the alleged defects and suggestions for corrections. Failure to file a timely objection will constitute acceptance of the Record. Within 14 days of receiving such written notice, the Session shall file a written response with the Commission and with the appellant/complainant. The chairman shall promptly send to the commissioners the notice of objection and the Session’s response. If no objection is filed, the parties are considered to have received the perfected Record on the day they received the original Record.</p>
<p class="p1">7. Resolving Disputes on the Record – If the Session agrees to any suggested correction, the Record shall be revised accordingly. If the Session does not agree to a suggested correction, the Commission shall consider the written arguments of both parties and rule whether the change(s) should be made. This ruling shall be made within 14 days of when the Commission received the Session’s response and the chairman shall promptly notify the parties of the ruling. If the original Record is revised, the chairman shall ensure both parties receive the perfected Record and the date of its receipt shall be recorded. In this event, the chairman shall also ensure the commissioners receive copies of the revision.</p>
<p class="p5">8. Filing Briefs – After the Record has been perfected, the parties may file briefs with the Commission. Such briefs are optional and additional to the notice of appeal/complaint (<i>BCO</i> 42-4, 43-3) and to the Session’s initial response (<i>BCO</i> 42-5, 43-6).</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">1. The appellant/complainant’s brief shall be filed no later than 14 days after he receives the perfected Record (or the original Record if undisputed.) The Commission will immediately send this brief to the Session and the delivery date shall be recorded. The chairman will promptly send this brief to the commissioners.</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">2. The Session’s brief shall be filed no later than 28 days after it receives the perfected Record (or the original Record if undisputed) or 14 days after it receives the appellant/complainant’s brief, whichever is later. The Commission will immediately send this brief to the appellant/complainant. The chairman will promptly send this brief to the commissioners.</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">3. The Commission should not schedule the hearing for sooner than 42 days after the date the parties receive the perfected Record (or the original Record if undisputed), unless both parties, in writing, waive their right to file briefs.</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">4. The briefs shall include the party’s position with regard to: a summary of the facts, a summary of the proceedings before the Session, a proposed statement of the issue(s), the proposed judgment &amp; relief, and the argument in favor of judgment &amp; relief.</span></p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">5. No brief shall make reference to any evidence not already part of the perfected Record. The Commission may, at its discretion, strike the part of any brief that makes such reference. Parties may petition the Commission to strike any alleged new evidence from a brief. At the same time, briefs may mention and the Commission may take judicial notice of facts not subject to reasonable dispute.</span></p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">6. A brief is limited to 10 pages. It must be typewritten on 8½ x 11-inch paper, with 1-inch margins on all sides, and no smaller than 10-point type. Any brief that does not meet these standards of form shall be returned to the sending party with reasons. If this occurs, a revised brief may be submitted, provided such brief is filed with the Commission within 5 days of when the party received notification that the brief did not meet the standard of form.</span></p>
<p class="p1">9. Before the hearing begins, the chairman shall call the members of the Commission to order and he shall:</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">1. Open the meeting with prayer and certify a quorum is present.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">2. Ask each member individually if he has read the Record and all briefs. Any member who cannot affirm such is disqualified from deliberating and voting.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">3. Remind the members to disregard all evidence not in the Record, even though such evidence may be found in the briefs of the parties or in oral argument.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">4. Read to the members the four principles adopted as Standards of Review in </span><i style="font-size: 16px;">BCO</i><span style="font-size: 16px;"> 39-3.</span></p>
<p class="p5">10. During the hearing:</p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">1. Before arguments begin, commissioners may question the parties on any matter before the court.</span></p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">2. The arguments shall be heard in the following order: 1) the appellant/complainant opens, 2) the Session responds, and 3) the appellant/complainant closes. Each party should be present to hear the arguments of the other.</span></p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">3. </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">A party shall have a maximum of 30 minutes to argue his case.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space" style="font-size: 16px;">  </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">For the appellant/complainant, these 30 minutes are inclusive of both his opening and closing arguments. He may divide that time as he chooses.</span></p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">4. At any time during which a party is presenting an argument, a commissioner may ask questions of that party. The time taken for such questions shall not form a part of the argument time of the party questioned.</span></p>
<p class="p1">11. Judgment – As soon as possible after hearing oral arguments, the Commission shall go into closed session and discuss the issues in the case. In that discussion, the Commission may frame the issues and vote on a Judgment. Or, the Commission may adjourn and reconvene within the next 10 days, as often as necessary, to do so.</p>
<p class="p1">12. Written Decision – After the Judgment is adopted, the chairman shall designate a member who voted with the majority to draft the written decision. If the chairman did not vote in the majority, the majority will select their own drafter. The decision shall contain four parts:</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">1. Summary of Facts (chronological summary of relevant history and facts bearing on case)</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">2. Statement of the Issue(s) (concise framing by the court of specific issue(s) being judged in case)</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">3. Judgment (definite conclusion rendered on the specific issue(s) being adjudged)</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">4. Reasoning and Opinion (reasons for judgment rendered and resolution of any disputed facts)</span></p>
<p class="p1">The drafter of the decision shall send it to the commissioners promptly enough so that within 21 days of adopting the Judgment, the Commission shall adopt a written decision and approve the minutes of its meetings. Any Commission member may file a concurring or dissenting opinion.</p>
<p class="p5">13. Reporting – Within 42 days after the hearing, the Commission shall file its report with the Presbytery Stated Clerk. In addition, any commissioner writing a concurring or dissenting opinion shall file it with the Presbytery Stated Clerk within 42 days after the hearing. The Commission’s report shall include the following:</p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">1. Commission’s written decision, including the vote.</span></p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">2. Minutes of the meetings of the Commission.</span></p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">3. Briefs of the Parties</span></p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">4. Record of the Case as perfected</span></p>
<p class="p1">15. For the purposes of computing times, the day of the act or event from which a designated period of time begins shall not be included. The last day of the period shall be included, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday or postal holiday, in which case the period extends until the end of the next day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or postal holiday. “Filing” shall not be timely unless the documents are received by the appropriate party within the time fixed for such filing. “Received” shall be when the documents are actually delivered to the party.</p>
<p class="p1">16. The Commission may extend any of the deadline dates in this Appendix, or page limits for briefs, upon its determination that so doing is required in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="p5">SUMMARY – This procedure would only apply to a Presbytery Judicial Commission acting as an appellate court. This procedure does not apply if a Presbytery chooses to hear any case as a whole body.</p>
<p class="p5">These procedures provide three distinct six-week (42 day) periods:</p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">1. Resolving any disputes on the Record</span></p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">2. Filing, distributing and reading briefs</span></p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">3. Conducting hearing, deliberating and filing full report with Stated Clerk</span></p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 80px;">Long Process – If the Record is disputed, and the parties choose to file briefs, and the full time is taken for all deadlines, the Commission might not file its final report with the Stated Clerk until four months (126 days) after the Presbytery meeting at which it was appointed. However, if the full time is not taken for all deadlines, the Commission may be able to file its report in time for the next Presbytery meeting, even if the Record is disputed and briefs are filed.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span class="s9">Medium Process</span> – If either the Record is not disputed or the parties waive their right to file briefs, and the full time is taken for all deadlines, a Commission should file its final report within 84 days (12 weeks). In most Presbyteries, this should be in time for the next meeting.</p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span class="s9">Short Process</span> – If the Record is not disputed, and the parties waive their right to file briefs, the Commission should file its report within 42 days of the hearing, which could be held as soon as the Commissioners have read the Record. This scenario would also result in Presbytery receiving the Commission’s report at the next Presbytery meeting.</p>
