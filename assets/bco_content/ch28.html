<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</h2>
<h4 class="p1"><i>Disciplining of Non-communing Members</i><i></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>28-1</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The spiritual nurture, instruction and training of the children of the Church are committed by God primarily to their parents. They are responsible to the Church for the faithful discharge of their obligations. It is a principal duty of the Church to promote true religion in the home. True discipleship involves learning the Word of God under the guidance of the Holy Spirit both at home and in the Church. Without learning there is no growth and without growth there is no discipline and without discipline there is sin and iniquity (1 Timothy 4:7).</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>28-2</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The home and the Church should also make special provision for instructing the children in the Bible and in the church Catechisms. To this end Sessions should establish and conduct under their authority Sunday schools and Bible classes, and adopt such other methods as may be found helpful. The Session shall encourage the parents of the Church to guide their children in the catechising and disciplining of them in the Christian religion.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>28-3</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The Church should maintain constant and sympathetic relations with the children. It also should encourage them, on coming to years of discretion, to make confession of the Lord Jesus Christ and to enter upon all privileges of full church membership. If they are wayward they should be cherished by the church and every means used to reclaim them.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>28-4</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Adult non-communing members, who receive with meekness and appreciation the oversight and instruction of the Church, are entitled to special attention. Their rights and privileges under the covenant should be frequently and fully explained, and they should be warned of the sin and danger of neglecting their covenant obligations.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>28-5</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>All non-communing members shall be deemed under the care of the church to which their parents belong, if they live under the parental roof and are minors; otherwise, under that of the church where they reside, or with which they ordinarily worship.</p>
