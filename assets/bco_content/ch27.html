<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</h2>
<h4 class="p1"><i>Discipline – Its Nature, Subjects and Ends</i></h4>
<h4 class="p1"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: #666666;"><strong>27-1.</strong> Discipline is the exercise of authority given the Church by the Lord Jesus Christ to instruct and guide its members and to promote its purity and welfare.</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The term has two senses:</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;">a.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>the one referring to the whole government, inspection, training, guardianship and control which the church maintains over its members, its officers and its courts;</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;">b.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><span class="s1">the other a restricted and technical sense, signifying judicial process.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><b>27-2</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>All baptized persons, being members of the Church are subject to its discipline and entitled to the benefits thereof.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>27-3</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The exercise of discipline is highly important and necessary. In its proper usage discipline maintains:</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;">a.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>the glory of God,</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;">b.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>the purity of His Church,</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;">c.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>the keeping and reclaiming of disobedient sinners. Discipline is for the purpose of godliness (1 Timothy 4:7); therefore, it demands a self-examination under Scripture.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><span class="s2">Its ends, so far as it involves judicial action, are the rebuke of offenses, the removal of scandal, the vindication of the honor of Christ, the promotion of the purity and general edification of the Church, and the spiritual good of offenders themselves.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><b>27-4</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><span class="s2">The power which Christ has given the Church is for building up, and not for destruction. It is to be exercised as under a dispensation of mercy and not of wrath. As in the preaching of the Word the wicked are doctrinally separated from the good, so by discipline the Church authoritatively separates between the holy and the profane. In this it acts the part of a tender mother, correcting her children for their good, that every one of them may be presented faultless in the day of the Lord Jesus. Discipline is systematic training under the authority of God’s Scripture. No communing or non-communing member of the Church should be allowed to stray from the Scripture’s discipline. Therefore, teaching elders must:</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;">a.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>instruct the officers in discipline,</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;">b.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>instruct the congregation in discipline,</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;">c.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>jointly practice it in the context of the congregation and church courts.<span class="s3"></span></p>
<p class="p7">
<p class="p1"><b>27-5</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Scriptural law is the basis of all discipline because it is the revelation of God’s Holy will.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Proper disciplinary principles are set forth in the Scriptures and must be followed. They are: </p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;">a.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Instruction in the Word;</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;">b.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Individual’s responsibility to admonish one another (Matthew 18:15, Galatians 6:1);</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;">c.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>If the admonition is rejected, then the calling of one or more witnesses (Matthew 18:16);</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;">d.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>If rejection persists, then the Church must act through her court unto admonition, suspension, excommunication and deposition (See <i>BCO</i> 29 and 30 for further explanation). </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Steps (a) through (d) must be followed in proper order for the exercise of discipline.</p>
