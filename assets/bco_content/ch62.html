<h2>CHAPTER SIXTY-TWO</h2>
<h4 class="p1"><i>Days of Fasting and Thanksgiving</i><i></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>62-1</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><span class="s1">The observance of days of fasting and of thanksgiving, as the dispensations of Divine Providence may direct, is both scriptural and rational.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><b>62-2</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Fasting and thanksgiving may be observed by individual Christians; by families; by particular congregations; by a number of congregations contiguous to each other; by the congregations under the care of a Presbytery; or by all the congregations of our Church.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>62-3</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><span class="s1">It should be left to the judgment and discretion of every Christian and family to determine when it is proper to observe a private fast or thanksgiving; and to the church Sessions to determine for particular congregations; and to the Presbyteries, to determine for larger districts. When it is deemed expedient that a fast or thanksgiving should be general, the call for it should be issued by the General Assembly. If at any time the civil power should appoint a fast or thanksgiving, in keeping with the Christian faith, it is the duty of the ministers and people of our communion to pay all due respect to it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><b>62-4</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Public notice should be given a sufficient time before the appointed day of fasting or thanksgiving, that persons may so order their affairs as to allow them to attend properly to the duties of the day.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>62-5</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>There should be public worship upon all such days; and the prayers, psalms or hymns, the selection of Scripture, and sermons, should all be in a special manner adapted to the occasion.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>62-6</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>On days of fasting, the minister should point out the authority and providences calling for the observance; and he should spend more than the usual time in solemn prayer, particular confession of sin, especially for the sins of the day and place; and the whole day should be spent in prayer and meditation.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>62-7.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>On days of thanksgiving, he should give information respecting the authority and providences which call for the observance; and he should spend more than the usual time in giving thanks, agreeably to the occasion, and in singing psalms or hymns of praise. On these days, the people should rejoice with holy gladness of heart; but their joy should be tempered with reverence, that they indulge in no excess or unbecoming levity.</p>
