<h2 class="p1">CHAPTER ONE</h2>
<h4 class="p1"><em>MEMBERSHIP</em><b></b></h4>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.1</strong> Membership shall be determined by the General Assembly in accordance with <i>BCO</i> 15-4.</p>

<h2 class="p1">CHAPTER TWO</h2>
<h4 class="p1"><em>CONDUCT OF COMMISSION MEMBERS</em><b></b></h4>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.1</strong> A member shall, at all times, keep in mind his high calling as an officer of the church of the Lord Jesus Christ and shall in all endeavors conduct himself in accordance with that calling. Further, since “ecclesiastical discipline… can derive no force whatever but from its own justice, the approbation of an impartial public, and the countenance and blessing of the great Head of the Church” (<i>BCO</i>, Preface, II. Preliminary Principles, 8), the members of the Standing Judicial Commission must maintain the highest standards of integrity, independence, impartiality, and competence.</p>
<p class="p8" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.2</strong> All members of the commission, including officers, shall be entitled to participate in the discussion and to vote on any matter pending before the commission for which they are qualified.</p>
<p class="p8" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.3</strong> A “qualified” member under these Rules is any member of the commission who:</p>
<p class="p10" style="padding-left: 80px;">a. in a hearing (<i>OMSJC</i> 10.8.a (2)) has read the Record of the Case and all briefs timely filed by the parties;</p>
<p class="p10" style="padding-left: 80px;">b. in a review or rehearing <i>OMSJC</i> 17.8.b has read the Judicial Panel’s proposed decision, all briefs timely filed by the parties, and that portion of the Record of the Case the member feels necessary to understand the issues of the case;</p>
<p class="p10" style="padding-left: 80px;">c. heard the arguments of the parties (if such arguments are presented) and the discussion as to the merits of the matters in controversy; and</p>
<p class="p10" style="padding-left: 80px;">d. is not disqualified for one or more of the reasons stated in Sections 2.4-2.12 below.</p>
<p class="p8" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.4</strong> A member shall not render judgment in any matter pending before the commission on the basis of anything other than the Constitution of the Church and the facts presented by the Record of the Case and the other materials properly before him. If he finds himself subject to any other influence, or if he finds himself unable to render the judgment so required, he shall recuse himself from further proceedings in that matter.</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.5</strong> A member of the Commission shall not make any public or private statement that might reasonably be expected to affect the outcome of a pending matter or impending matter in any court of the church (<i>BCO</i> 11-4; 39-3).</p>
<p class="p10" style="padding-left: 80px;">a. A pending matter is a matter with respect to which process (<i>BCO</i> 31-2, ¶ 2) has commenced or which has been filed under the Rules of Discipline with the appropriate court. A matter continues to be pending through any appellate process. (<i>BCO</i> 39-1).</p>
<p class="p10" style="padding-left: 80px;">b. An impending matter is a matter that is reasonably expected to (a) become a case of process or (b) otherwise be brought before an appropriate court for consideration. “Reasonably” refers to the judgment of one in possession of all the relevant facts, which facts are subject to a fair-minded assessment.</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.6</strong>. So long as he complies with Section 2.5 above, a member may make public or private statements in the course of his duties as a presbyter or Session member with respect to biblical teaching, confessional interpretation, the principles of the form of government and discipline, the requirements of the <i>BCO</i>, the <i>Rules of Assembly Operation</i>, <i>Robert&#8217;s Rules</i>, and may explain Commission procedures. <span class="s2">If such statements seem to the member especially liable to be construed to address a pending or impending matter before the Commission, a member making such public or private statements shall expressly qualify the statements indicating that they are limited to the subject matters permitted by this subsection and are not made with a view to any pending or impending matter.</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.7</strong>. A member of the Commission shall not discuss or comment on a pending or impending case with any party in the case or any person other than a Commission member, except as otherwise provided in the Manual or in the <i>BCO</i>.</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.8</strong>. Notwithstanding Section 2.5 above, a member of the Commission may fully participate in a judicial matter before the Presbytery or Session of which he is a member and advise his Presbytery or Session in judicial matters.</p>
<p class="p16" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.9</strong>. A member of the Commission shall not represent himself or any other party before the Commission.</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.10</strong>. A member of the Commission shall perform the duties of his office with impartiality and shall be diligent to maintain the impartiality of the Commission.</p>
<p class="p10" style="padding-left: 80px;">a. A member must be objective and open-minded with respect to all issues and parties.</p>
<p class="p10" style="padding-left: 80px;">b. A member shall not, in connection with cases, controversies, or issues that are likely to come before the court, make pledges, promises, or commitments that are inconsistent with the impartial performance of the duties of his office.</p>
<p class="p10" style="padding-left: 80px;">c. A member shall not initiate, permit, or consider <i>ex parte</i> communications, or consider other communications made to the member outside the presence of the parties or their representatives, concerning a pending or impending matter, except as follows:</p>
<p class="p19" style="padding-left: 120px;">(1) When circumstances require it, <i>ex parte</i> communication for scheduling, administrative, or emergency purposes, which does not address <span class="s3">substantive matters, is permitted to a Commission</span> <span class="s3">officer, or panel convener, chairman, or secretary.</span></p>
<p class="p19" style="padding-left: 120px;">(2) If a member receives an unauthorized <i>ex parte</i> communication bearing upon the substance of a matter, the member shall promptly notify the Officers of the substance of the communication in writing. The Officers shall promptly notify the parties of the substance of the communication in writing.</p>
<p class="p19" style="padding-left: 120px;">(3) A member shall not investigate facts in a matter independently, and shall consider only the evidence presented and any facts that may properly be judicially noticed.</p>
<p class="p19" style="padding-left: 80px;">d. A member shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which the member’s impartiality might reasonably (see Section 2.5.b) be questioned, including but not limited to the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="p19" style="padding-left: 120px;">(1) The member has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party or a party’s representative, or personal knowledge of facts that are in dispute in the proceeding, which is inconsistent with the impartial performance of the duties of his office.</p>
<p class="p19" style="padding-left: 120px;">(2) The member, while a member or after nomination to membership, has made a public statement, other than in a court proceeding, judicial decision, or opinion, that commits or appears to commit the member to reach a particular result or rule in a particular way in the proceeding or controversy.</p>
<p class="p21" style="padding-left: 120px;"><span class="s2">(3) The member </span>or a family member (i.e. sibling, parent, child, or spouse, and the spouse of any sibling, parent, or child):</p>
<p class="p22" style="padding-left: 160px;">i. served as a representative in the matter in controversy;</p>
<p class="p22" style="padding-left: 160px;">ii. was a witness concerning the matter; or</p>
<p class="p23" style="padding-left: 160px;"><span class="s2">iii. is a member of a court which is party to </span><span class="s4">the case </span>or was a commissioner to a court which is a party to the case during the time of the proceedings in question.</p>
<p class="p10" style="padding-left: 80px;">e. A member subject to disqualification under this chapter shall disclose on the record the basis of the member’s disqualification.</p>
<p class="p25" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.11</strong>. A member of the Commission shall conduct his extra-Commission activities to minimize the risk of conflict with the obligations of office thereby ensuring that he is available to fulfill his duties. A member shall not participate in activities that require the frequent disqualification of the member.</p>
<p class="p16" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.12</strong>. The enforcement of the Commission’s standards of conduct shall be as follows:</p>
<p class="p10" style="padding-left: 80px;">a. Concerns with respect to a member’s conduct as a member of the Commission shall be directed to the Officers of the Commission who shall respond to those<b> </b>concerns, after consulting with the member.</p>
<p class="p10" style="padding-left: 80px;">b. If the eligibility of a member is questioned, the chairman shall rule on the member’s eligibility. By majority vote the Commission may reverse the ruling of the chairman on the member’s eligibility.</p>
<p class="p10" style="padding-left: 80px;">c. To maintain order and decorum at meetings the <span class="s3">procedures and sanctions of <i>RONR</i> (12th ed.), 61:6-61:21,</span> shall be available to the Commission, except that the Commission may not suspend the rights of membership or expel a member from the Commission.</p>
<p class="p10" style="padding-left: 80px;">d. By a two-thirds vote the Commission may recommend to the General Assembly that a Commission member be removed from the Commission for cause. The recommendation shall include a brief statement of the grounds for the recommendation.</p>
<p class="p10" style="padding-left: 80px;">e. Should the conduct leading to a recommendation that a <span class="s3">member be removed from the Commission be potentially</span> liable to censure under the Rules of Discipline, the Commission may include in its recommendation to the General Assembly a further recommendation that the grounds for removal be forwarded to the appropriate court of original jurisdiction for consideration under <i>BCO </i>31-2.</p>

<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1">In the event that the Officers find that a case is not administratively in order (<i>OMSJC</i> 9.1(a)), or a Judicial Panel finds that a case is not judicially in order (<i>OMSJC</i> 9.1(b) &amp; <i>OMSJC</i> 10.5-6), each party may file a review brief setting out the party’s position regarding whether the case is in order. In such review brief the parties may allude to those documents that have been supplied by the lower court as the proposed Record of the Case and may additionally allude to any documents that were not submitted as part of the proposed Record of the Case but only if such documents bear on whether the case is in order. Review briefs shall be filed with and reviewed by the officers if no panel has been assigned and shall be filed with and reviewed by a panel if a panel has been assigned.</span></p>
<p class="p46" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>8.<span class="s1">2</span></strong> Preliminary Briefs</p>

In this case a revised brief may be submitted provided that such brief is filed with the Stated Clerk within 5 days of notification that the brief does not meet the standard of form.</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>8.<span class="s1">6</span></strong> Failure to file a brief by a party shall not be considered to be an abandonment of the case.</p>

<h2 class="p1">CHAPTER NINE</h2>
<h4 class="p1"><em>ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE</em><b></b></h4>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>9.1</strong> When a judicial case is submitted to the Commission, the Officers shall make an initial determination as to whether the case is administratively in order.</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 80px;">a. A case is administratively in order if the relevant provisions of <em>BCO</em> 41, 42, and 43 have been followed, including but not limited to:</p>
<p class="p35" style="padding-left: 120px;"><span class="s1">(1)</span> <span class="s1">an Appeal must include specification(s) of error set forth concisely in numbered paragraphs for each error alleged to support the Appeal (<i>BCO</i> 42-3, -8; cf. <i>BCO</i>, Forms For Judicial Business Appendix G, V Appeal). If an Appeal fails this qualification, putting the case in order (<i>OMSJC</i> 9.2 a.) shall include only formatting, not substantive, changes.</span></p>
<p class="p35" style="padding-left: 120px;"><span class="s1"> (2)</span> <span class="s1">a Complaint must include a statement of the action(s) or delinquency(s) complained of and the reasons supporting said complaint set forth concisely in numbered paragraphs (<i>BCO</i> 43-2; <i>BCO</i>, Forms for Judicial Business Appendix G, VI Complaint). If a Complaint fails this qualification, putting the case in order (<i>OMSJC</i> 9.2 a.) shall include only formatting, not substantive, changes.</span></p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span class="s1">b.</span> If a majority of the Officers cannot agree, then it shall be submitted to the full Commission at its next meeting.</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>9.2</strong></p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">a. If a case is <span class="s1">preliminarily</span> found not to be administratively in order <span class="s1">or not to be judicially in order</span>, the <span class="s1">Officers or a Panel shall reduce to writing the ground for such preliminary finding, including any conclusion as to whether the case either can or cannot be put in order. The </span>Stated Clerk shall <span class="s1">notify </span>the relevant parties or clerks <span class="s1">of such preliminary conclusion</span> and request that the case be put in order<span class="s1">, if possible, and advise the parties that the party bringing the appeal or complaint may file a review brief within 15 days of such notification. The Respondent may file a responsive review brief within 15 days of the first review brief</span>.</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">b. In cases where the Officers or a Panel have made such a preliminary finding that the case is out of order, the Officers or Panel, as the case may be, shall, after the 30- day period described above has expired, and after reviewing any review brief(s), make a secondary determination as to whether the case is in order. No party shall be entitled to an oral hearing on such a jurisdictional question without the consent of the Officers or Commission as the case may be. If the Officers’ or Panel’s secondary conclusion is that the case is not in order, no further action shall be taken in relation to the case other than to recommend to the next meeting of the Commission that the case be dismissed on the ground that the case is out of order. That recommendation shall include a statement setting forth the ground(s) for the conclusion that the case is not in order and either an explanation as to why it cannot be put in order or that the parties have failed to timely put the case in order despite an opportunity to do so. Alternatively, the Officers or Panel may, based on the review brief(s), find that the case is administratively in order and proceed with the case, subject to the review of any jurisdictional question by the Full Commission.</p>
<p class="p51" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span class="s2">c. </span><span class="s1">In cases where it is determined that the case should be heard by the Full Commission and the Commission makes a preliminary finding that the case is out of order, the Commission shall reduce to writing the ground for such preliminary finding, including any conclusion as to whether the case either can or cannot be put in order. The Stated Clerk shall notify the relevant parties or clerks of such preliminary conclusion and request that the case be put in order, if possible, and advise the parties that they may file a review brief within 30 days of such notification. After the 30-day period described above has expired, and after reviewing any review brief(s), the Commission shall make a final determination as to whether the case is in order. No party shall be entitled to an oral hearing on such a jurisdictional question without the consent of the Commission.</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>9.3</strong> When the case is administratively in order, the Officers shall determine whether the case is of such significance that it should be heard by the full Commission or submitted to a Judicial Panel. Ordinarily, it will be submitted to such a Judicial Panel.</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>9.4</strong> <span class="s3">If it is determined that the case should be heard by the Full Commission, the parties shall be notified and a full copy of the Record of the Case shall be sent to each member of the Commission. When the Record of the Case has been perfected under <i>OMSJC</i> 7, and when the parties have had opportunity to file </span>briefs under <i>OMSJC</i> 8.1, the case shall be docketed for hearing by the Full Commission at its next stated meeting, or at a called meeting set to hear the case.</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>9.5</strong> If it is determined that the case should be heard by a Judicial Panel, the Officers shall immediately appoint such a Judicial Panel in accordance with <i>RAO</i> 17.3.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER TEN</h2>
<h4 class="p4"><em>JUDICIAL PANELS</em></h4>
<p class="p4" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>10.1</strong> A Judicial Panel shall consist of at least five qualified (<em>OMSJC</em> 2.3.d) members of the Commission, which shall include at least two teaching elders and two ruling elders.</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>10.2</strong> Should, in the judgment of the officers, circumstances warrant, larger panels may be appointed with an approximately equal balance between teaching and ruling elders.</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>10.3</strong> When a Judicial Panel is appointed, one member thereof shall be designated as “Convener.” The Convener may make initial contact with the parties:</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">a. to obtain information for the initial meetings of the Panel;</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">b. to answer initial questions by the parties;</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">c. to answer questions of the parties concerning the preparation and submission of written briefs.</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">d. to begin the process of considering corrections to the Record of the Case, if any (see <i>OMSJC </i>7-4).</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>10.4</strong> CONSTITUTING MEETING. Within 10 days of the date of the receipt of the Record of the Case from the Stated Clerk, the Convener shall call a meeting of the Judicial Panel members. This first meeting may be held by telephone conference call. At this first meeting, the Judicial Panel shall organize itself by:</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">a. the election of a Chairman;</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">b. the election of a Secretary;</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">c. the selection of a tentative time and place for hearing the case;</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">d. such other organizational matters as would speed the time of hearing without prejudicing the rights of any of the parties.</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>10.5 </strong>INITIAL MEETING. Not later than 30 days after the receipt of the Record of the Case under <i>OMSJC</i> 7.3, and subject to the requirements of <i>OMSJC</i> 7.4, the Chairman of the Panel may call a second meeting of the Judicial Panel members, which meeting may also be held by a telephone conference call. This second meeting may form part of the first organizational meeting of the Judicial Panel referred to under <i>OMSJC</i> 10.4 if the requirements of <i>OMSJC</i> 7.4 have been met. The purpose of this second meeting shall be to determine if the case is judicially in order and ready for hearing. This review shall include:</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">a. that the case was timely filed as provided in <i>BCO</i> 42-4 and 43-2;</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">b. in the case of a complaint, that the complaint was first filed with the Court whose act or decision is alleged to be in error (<i>BCO</i> 43-2);</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">c. that a ground or reason has been specified as required by <i>BCO</i> 42-3 and 43-2;</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">d. that the parties have complied with the Rules of Discipline of the <i>BCO</i> and this Manual;</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">e. that the Record of the Case appears to be complete and sufficiently documented.</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>10.6</strong> If the Judicial Panel determines that a case is not judicially in order, the Panel through the Stated Clerk shall notify the parties and give them an opportunity to cure the defect, if it can be cured within the Rules of Discipline of the <i>BCO</i> and the requirements of this Manual. If the defect is cured within 30 days from receipt of such notice, the Panel shall proceed to hear and adjudicate the case. Except as noted below, if significant defects are not cured within 30 days from the receipt of notice then the Panel may make a determination that the case not be found in order and take no further action in relation to the case other than to recommend to the next meeting of the Commission that the case be dismissed on the ground that the case was not found in order. If, however, the defect is due to the neglect or failure of the lower court to provide a Record of the Case that is “complete and sufficiently documented” as defined in <i>BCO</i> 32-18, 42-5, and <i>OMSJC</i> 7, then the Panel shall apply <i>BCO</i> 42-7 or 43-6 as appropriate. If the decision of the Panel is not confirmed by the Commission, the Commission may return the case to the Panel, or may appoint a new Panel in accordance with <i>RAO</i> 17.3 to hear and adjudicate the case, or may decide to hear the case as the Full Commission.</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>10.7</strong> When the Judicial Panel determines that the case is judicially in order, the Chairman of the Judicial Panel shall take the following actions:</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">a. Set a date and time and, if necessary, a place for a hearing of the case, making every reasonable effort to obtain such date and time and or place as may be agreeable to all parties. A panel hearing will normally be held by electronic conference unless a member of the panel determines that the nature of the case warrants a face-to-face hearing.</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">b. Notify all parties of such time and place of hearing by electronic means. Such notice shall be sent not less than 40 days prior to the date of hearing and there must be a receipt of acknowledgement in the file from each party. Such 40 day period may be shortened if the parties to the case agree in writing.</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">c. Notify all parties of their right to submit written briefs, in accordance with <i>OMSJC</i> 8. A written brief must comply with <i>OMSJC</i> 8.3 and following.</p>

<p class="p35" style="padding-left: 120px;">(3) The Chairman shall enjoin the Panel or Commission members to recollect and regard their high character as judges of a court of Jesus Christ and the solemn duty in which they are about to engage (<i>BCO </i>32-12).</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">b. Furthermore, the Chairman shall:</p>
<p class="p35" style="padding-left: 120px;">(1) Remind the Panel or Commission Members that they should disregard all evidence not in the Record of the Case (<i>BCO </i>32-18); even though such evidence may be found in the briefs of the parties or in oral argument (See <i>OMSJC</i> 8.3).</p>
<p class="p35" style="padding-left: 120px;">(2) Read to the Panel or Commission member<b>s</b> the principles<b> </b>of Review set forth in <i>BCO </i>39-3.</p>

A Judicial Panel immediately after hearing the oral arguments of the parties, shall go into closed session and discuss the issues in the case. In that discussion, the Panel may (1) frame the issues, (2) vote on a judgment and (3) announce these to the parties. Or, the Panel may take all these matters under advisement and reconvene within the next 20 days, as often as necessary, to frame the issues and render a judgment. This &#8220;reconvening&#8221; may be held by telephone conference call. The Chairman of the Panel shall designate a Panel member voting with the majority to prepare a written decision. This decision shall be sent by electronic means to the Stated Clerk of the General Assembly within 40 days from the date the Panel heard the oral arguments. Any Panel member may file, within said 40 day period, a concurring or dissenting opinion which shall be appended to the decision.</p>

<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">c. Where the Officers decide that the Commission should not accede to the request of the lower court to hear the case, the question shall be placed on the docket of the next stated or called meeting of the Commission for final determination.</p>

<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>12.5</strong> The Commission shall be organized as in any other case, except the trial of such a case shall be conducted under the “General Provisions Applicable To All Cases Of Process” as set out in <i>BCO</i> 32, and in accordance with rules of evidence as set out in <i>BCO</i> 35.</p>

<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>17.5</strong> Proposed judgments of a Judicial Panel are not binding on the parties, but the Stated Clerk shall transmit to the parties a copy of the panel’s proposed decision and inform the parties of their right to request a rehearing before the full Standing Judicial Commission. If any party desires a rehearing by the full Commission, such request must be filed with the Stated Clerk within 14 days after receipt of said Panel’s proposed and recommended decision. Said party filing such a request for rehearing may attach a brief giving such party’s reasons and arguments for this request. Such brief must comply with the requirement of <i>OMSJC</i> 8.3-8.5 of this Manual as it relates to supplemental briefs.</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>17.6</strong> If no member of the Judicial Panel shall request a rehearing but a party shall have timely requested under Section 17.5 a rehearing by the full Commission, the Stated Clerk shall send by electronic means a ballot to each Commission member which shall have a place for each member to indicate his vote in favor of or against such party’s request. Each member shall complete and file such ballot with the Stated Clerk within 15 days of the receipt of the electronic notice. If any member fails to file such ballot by electronic means within said 15 days, or shall file the ballot without completing it, that member’s vote shall be recorded as a vote against the request for such a rehearing.</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>17.7</strong> A rehearing of the case by the full Standing Judicial Commission shall be had only in the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">a. <span class="s3">Where, within 15 days of the receipt of the ballot from the</span> Stated Clerk under Section 17.6 at least seven qualified members of the full Commission shall request <span class="s3">by mail or electronic means (including any requests made</span> under <i>OMSJC</i> 17.7.d), by ballot or by separate written notice to the Stated Clerk or the Secretary of the Commission, that the case be reheard by the full Commission; or</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">b. In the case of a Panel of three voting members or less, where one voting member of the Judicial Panel hearing the case shall so request under <i>OMSJC</i> 10.11.a; or</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">c. In the case of a Panel of four voting members or more, where two voting members of the Judicial Panel hearing the case shall so request under <i>OMSJC</i> 10.11.a; or</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">d. Where seven members of the Standing Judicial Commission shall file by electronic means written request for such rehearing within 15 days of the receipt of the proposed decision under Section 17.5.</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>17.8</strong></p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">a. Every Judicial Panel’s proposed and recommended decision shall be reviewed by the full Commission. In addition, those cases approved under Section 17.7 shall be reheard. A “review” means that the full Commission shall consider, discuss and debate each decision. A “rehearing” means that in addition to a “review”, the full Commission shall hear the oral arguments of the parties.</p>
<p class="p10" style="padding-left: 80px;">b. After hearing the oral arguments in a case where a rehearing is granted under Section 17.7, or immediately when a case is called for review if there is no rehearing, the presiding officer of the full Commission shall poll each member present as to whether or not they have read the following:</p>
<p class="p35" style="padding-left: 120px;">(1) the Judicial Panel’s proposed and recommended decision;</p>
<p class="p35" style="padding-left: 120px;">(2) all briefs timely filed by the parties;</p>
<p class="p35" style="padding-left: 120px;">(3) those portions of the Record of the Case such member feels is necessary to understand the issues of the case.</p>
<p class="p35" style="padding-left: 120px;">Any member who is not able to certify affirmatively to these inquiries shall not be eligible to participate in discussion or vote on this case.</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">c. After the completion of (b) above, the Court shall go into closed session but may permit the Stated Clerk and his assistant(s) to remain to assist with the taking of the minutes.</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">d. Then the consideration and discussion of the proposed and recommended decision of the Panel shall begin with members of the Panel briefing the full Commission on the facts of the case, the Panel’s statement of the issues, <span class="s3">the Panel’s proposed judgment and the Panel’s Reasoning</span> and Opinion. Any dissenting member of the Panel may <span class="s3">then present his reasons for dissent. The full Commission</span> will then enter upon a regular parliamentary procedure to perfect, revise, change or approve any part of the Panel’s proposed and recommended decision.</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">e. In this procedure, each of the 4 parts of the proposed and recommended decision shall be perfected.</p>
<p class="p35" style="padding-left: 120px;">(1) The Summary of the Facts</p>
<p class="p35" style="padding-left: 120px;">(2) The Statement of the Issues</p>
<p class="p35" style="padding-left: 120px;">(3) The Judgment</p>
<p class="p35" style="padding-left: 120px;">(4) The Reasoning and Opinion of the Court.</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">f. After all 4 parts have been approved individually then the decision as a whole shall be voted on by roll call without change or amendment.</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">g. All qualified members present should participate in the vote and the vote of each member shall be included in the written decision.</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">h. Upon such review, if parts 1, 2 and 3 of the decision have been perfected but part 4 &#8211; the Reasoning and Opinion of the Court needs to be rewritten and cannot be done at that meeting of the Commission, the Chairman of the Commission shall designate a member or a committee of members voting with the majority on the other 3 parts to write the proposed reasoning and opinion based on the decisions on the other 3 parts. The Chairman, upon consulting with the members of the Commission present, shall:</p>
<p class="p35" style="padding-left: 120px;">(1) set a date and time for a telephone conference call for the perfecting and voting on the “Reasoning and Opinion” part of the decision;</p>
<p class="p35" style="padding-left: 120px;">(2) this date shall be at least 30 days in advance and not more than 45 days in advance;</p>
<p class="p35" style="padding-left: 120px;">(3) the members or committee of members appointed to write “The Reasoning and Opinion” shall agree to have a proposal in the hands of the Stated Clerk of the General Assembly within 15 days;</p>
<p class="p35" style="padding-left: 120px;">(4) the Stated Clerk shall send the proposal by electronic means to each member of the Commission at least 10 days before the date set for such telephone conference call;</p>
<p class="p35" style="padding-left: 120px;">(5) the Stated Clerk shall in the same <span class="s1">communication</span> send to each Commission member a written ballot;</p>
<p class="p35" style="padding-left: 120px;">(6) if any Commissioner cannot participate in the telephone conference call, his vote on the decision as a whole will be counted so as to be consistent with his vote on the other parts. If he wishes to change his vote, he may fax a copy of his signed written ballot to the Stated Clerk at or before the time of the telephone conference call;</p>
<p class="p35" style="padding-left: 120px;">(7) when “The Reasoning and Opinion” part of the decision has been perfected, then the Chairman shall call for a roll call vote on the decision as a whole and announce the decision;</p>
<p class="p35" style="padding-left: 120px;">(8) the other 3 portions of the decision previously approved may not be altered or revised on this telephone conference call.</p>
<p class="p35" style="padding-left: 120px;">(9) <span class="s3">After all 4 parts have been approved individually,</span> then the decision as a whole shall be voted on by roll call without change or amendment.</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">i. <span class="s5">After a decision has been reached by the Full Commission,</span> any member may file, within 14 days after the date the text of the decision is sent by the Secretary to the members of the Commission, a concurring or dissenting opinion, which, if it conforms with the requirements of <i>OMSJC</i> 18.12, shall be included as an appendix to the decision when it is sent to the parties. The decision and any concurring or dissenting opinions shall be sent to the parties and released to the public at the same time and only after the procedures of <i>OMSJC</i> 18.12 have been completed. (See also 17.2)</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>17.9</strong></p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">a. In the event of a hearing by the Full Commission where the case was not heard by a judicial panel, the Commission shall issue to the parties a preliminary <span class="s3">judgment. Within 14 days after receiving the preliminary</span> judgment, a party may request reconsideration of the judgment by filing a supplemental brief as set forth in <i>OMSJC</i> 8.2. This supplemental brief shall state the reasons for requesting reconsideration of the preliminary <span class="s3">judgment. The commission at its next meeting shall consider the request for reconsideration. Reconsideration</span> of the preliminary judgment shall be granted only by majority vote of the Full Commission.</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">b. If reconsideration is granted, the Commission shall immediately go into closed session to discuss the case, consider its merits, and render a final judgment. If reconsideration is not granted, the preliminary judgment shall become final in accordance with <i>BCO</i> 15-5(a).</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h2>
<h4 class="p4"><em>MISCELLANEOUS</em><b></b></h4>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>18.1</strong> Any meeting of the Commission or a Judicial Panel shall be opened and closed with prayer.</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>18.2</strong> All oral arguments by the parties before the Commission or a Judicial Panel thereof shall be electronically recorded. No other recordings are authorized without the consent of all of the parties and the approval of the Panel/Commission. SJC recordings shall be kept by the Stated Clerk for the use of the SJC until the case has been finally determined, and then such recordings may be destroyed. Upon request, the Officers may authorize the use of SJC recordings.</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>18.3</strong></p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">a. Multiple complaints against the same act or decision of a lower court may be combined into one case but each complainant shall receive individual notices issued under this Manual. However, such multiple complainants may designate one of their number to be representative of the multiple complainants, and in such a case notices issued under this Manual shall be sent to that complainant.</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">b. A single complaint signed by more than one person against the same act or decision of a lower court shall be treated as a single complaint and all notices issued under this Manual shall be sent to the first named complainant.</p>
<p class="p62" style="padding-left: 80px;">c. In either of the cases under <i>OMSJC</i> 12.8.a or b where a hearing is held under this Manual the multiple complainants shall be treated as one complainant and:</p>
<p class="p35" style="padding-left: 120px;">(1) be granted the same total amount of time to present oral arguments as would have been given to a single complainant to present oral arguments; and</p>
<p class="p35" style="padding-left: 120px;">(2) be permitted to present one combined brief and supplemental brief (if the circumstances permit a <span class="s5">supplemental brief) and such brief or supplemental</span> brief shall meet the same requirements as would <span class="s3">be imposed upon a single complainant presenting</span> a brief or supplemental brief.</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>18.4</strong></p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">a.If at any time up to 15 days prior to the date set for a Judicial Panel or the Commission to hear a judicial reference, appeal or complaint, a party asserts that new evidence has been obtained, which was not available or was not made available because of justifiable circumstances at the time the Record of the Case was put together, said new evidence shall be put in writing and sent within 5 days to the Stated Clerk and shall be received as part of the Record of the Case only when all the parties stipulate in writing agreeing to the new evidence. If the parties do not agree to this stipulation, and the party presenting the new evidence insists that it is material to the case, the proceedings shall be suspended and the matter docketed at the next meeting of the Panel or the Commission to make a determination as to whether the new evidence to be offered has an important bearing on the case. At that next meeting, the Panel or Commission may decide:</p>
<p class="p35" style="padding-left: 120px;">(1) that the new evidence does not have an important bearing on the case and proceed with the case; or</p>
<p class="p35" style="padding-left: 120px;">(2) that the new evidence does have an important bearing on the case and refer the case to the lower court for a new trial (BCO 35-16).</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">b. If at any time during the 15 days immediately prior to the date set for a Judicial Panel or the Commission to hear the case, a party asserts that new evidence has been obtained, which was not available or was not made available because of justifiable circumstances, at the time the Record of the Case was put together, said new evidence shall be put in writing and be presented to the Panel or Commission before any oral arguments are presented on the substance of the case. Under these circumstances, the Panel or Commission before proceeding to hear oral arguments, shall receive the new evidence into the Record of the Case only if all parties stipulate in writing agreeing to such new evidence. If the parties cannot agree to this stipulation, and the party presenting the new evidence insists that it is material to the case, the Panel or Commission shall make a determination as to whether the new evidence to be offered has an important bearing on the case. The Panel or Commission may then decide:</p>
<p class="p35" style="padding-left: 120px;">(1) that the new evidence does not have an important bearing on the case and proceed with the case; or</p>
<p class="p35" style="padding-left: 120px;">(2) that the new evidence does have an important bearing on the case and refer the case to the lower court for a new trial (BCO 35-16).</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>18.5</strong> All issues before the Standing Judicial Commission, or a Judicial Panel thereof, shall be decided by a majority vote of those qualified members voting. There shall be no proxy voting.</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>18.6</strong> The minutes of the meetings of the SJC must be approved by electronic ballot within 20 days after receipt of such minutes. If any member fails to file with the Stated Clerk the ballot within 20 days, that member’s vote shall be recorded as approval of the minutes.</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>18.7</strong> ABANDONMENT</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;">If an appellant, complainant or party initiating a case referred to the Commission fails to appear, in person or by a qualified representative, after receiving proper notice, at any meeting of the Standing Judicial Commission, or a Judicial Panel thereof, such party shall be deemed to have abandoned the case. The Stated Clerk shall immediately notify the party that the case has been dismissed because of the failure to appear, and the party shall have 10 days from the receipt of such notice to present, in writing, a satisfactory explanation of the failure to appear and prosecute the case. If the explanation is deemed sufficient by the Officers of the Commission, or members of the Judicial Panel, the case shall be reinstated and reset for another hearing; otherwise, it shall stand abandoned and dismissed.</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>18.8</strong>WAIVER OF RIGHTS TO APPEAR</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">a. Any party may upon a showing of good cause waive his right to appear before the higher court and present oral argument. This waiver shall be accomplished by a written notice to the higher court, sent by electronic means not less than 14 days prior to the scheduled hearing, stating the reasons for the waiver. A party’s waiver has no effect upon the other party’s right of appearance.</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">b. The higher court, if it fails to find good cause for the waiver, may refuse to accept a waiver of appearance. If the requested waiver is rejected by the higher court, it shall promptly notify the party who requested the waiver. The party shall then be required to appear before the higher court at the scheduled time and place.</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">c. Failure to so appear shall constitute an abandonment of the case by that party, unless within 10 days after the date of the scheduled hearing that party provides satisfactory explanation of the failure to appear. If this explanation is deemed sufficient by the higher court and if the higher court believes the interests of justice will be served thereby, the case shall be reset for another hearing. If no further hearing is required, the case may be decided forthwith. If the party’s explanation for not appearing is not deemed sufficient by the higher court, the case shall stand abandoned and dismissed.</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>18.9</strong> In computing any period of time prescribed by this Manual, the day of the act or event from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included. The last day of the period shall be included, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday or postal holiday, in which event the period extends until the end of the next day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or postal holiday.</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>18.10</strong> When a provision of the Manual requires a computation of time under Section 18.9, above, such period of time shall be computed with the following construction of certain terms used herein, towit:</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">a. A communication from the Commission or Panel shall be computed from the day after the document is sent electronically.</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">b. Documents required or permitted to be filed by a party shall be filed with the Stated Clerk. Such filing shall be sent via electronic means and shall not be timely unless the documents are received by electronic means in the office of the Stated Clerk by 11:59 PM (Eastern Time) on the deadline date. Interested parties should be aware that responsibility for such filings rests with them and that problems in delivery or non-delivery are the sole responsibility of the filing party. An electronic confirmation of receipt shall be conclusive evidence of delivery.</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">c. &#8220;Notice,&#8221; &#8220;notification,&#8221; &#8220;from receipt,&#8221; &#8220;after the receipt&#8221; shall be the local date on which the party received the electronic delivery, as ordinarily confirmed by a return email. For all papers requiring such, the Commission shall be responsible for obtaining verification of date of delivery. However, compliance with such requirements shall be deemed to have been fulfilled in any of the following instances, to wit:</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 120px;">(1) If a party changes his/her contact or email address without notifying the Office of the Stated Clerk. (2) If a party cannot be located after diligent inquiry.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 120px;">(2) If a party cannot be located after diligent inquiry.</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 120px;">(3) If a party refuses to accept delivery of materials or notice, or refuses to confirm receipt of an electronic communication.</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 120px;">(4) If materials or notice are returned to the sender with an electronic notice of being undeliverable or by the carrier with a notation that delivery could not be accomplished.</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">d. The Judicial Panel, or the Commission if the case is to be heard by the Commission, may extend any of the deadline dates if it determines that so doing is in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>18.11</strong> The Record of the Case, Briefs, Arguments, and all proceedings before a Panel or the Commission shall be presented in the English language.</p>
<p class="p64" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>18.12.</strong>CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINIONS</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">a. The right of a Commission member to file a Concurring or Dissenting <span class="s3">Opinion (see 17.8.i) is an essential element of the work of the Commission,</span> in that it preserves the unity of the Commission by allowing <span class="s3">a member in the minority to submit to the Commission’s judgment, while</span> declaring, and thus <span class="s3">clearing, </span><span class="s5">his conscience in a particular decision. An Objection (<i>BCO</i> 45-1, 4)</span> is only permissible in the case of an otherwise qualified member of the Commission (cf. <i>OMSJC</i> 2.2-.3) who could not vote due to being a member of the presbytery or a member of a congregation in the bounds of the presbytery from which the case arose (cf. <i>BCO</i> 39-2).</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">b. That right notwithstanding, in order to preserve the primacy of, the authority of, and respect for Commission decisions, any Concurring or Dissenting opinion, which does not qualify as a minority decision under the terms of <i>BCO </i>15-5<i>,</i> shall meet the following standards:</p>
<p class="p65" style="padding-left: 120px;">(1) Concurring or Dissenting opinions shall set forth concisely, as the case may be, the alternate grounds upon which the Commission’s decision ought to have <span class="s5">been rendered; or, the alleged error of the Commission’s</span> decision, a statement of the decision that should have been rendered, and the grounds sustaining.</p>
<p class="p65" style="padding-left: 120px;">(2) Ordinarily Concurring or Dissenting opinions should set forth positions or employ arguments that were offered in the course of the Commission’s proceedings on a case.</p>
<p class="p65" style="padding-left: 120px;">(3) Concurring or Dissenting opinions shall be couched in temperate <span class="s7">language conducive to maintaining respect for the Commission, vigorous</span> expression of disagreement with the decision notwithstanding.</p>
<p class="p65" style="padding-left: 120px;">(4) <span class="s3">Concurring or Dissenting opinions shall conform to the</span> <span class="s5">specifications for a preliminary brief (<i>OMSJC</i> 8.5.a-b.).</span></p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">c. At the request of four SJC members within 14 days after the date the text of the Concurring or Dissenting Opinion is sent by the Secretary to the members of the SJC, the Chairman shall call a special meeting of the Commission, upon at least fourteen (14) days’ notice, by telephone or video conference to consider<span class="s3"> either (1) a motion to adopt an Answer to any Concurring or Dissenting Opinion or (2) a motion to strike the Opinion for failing to meet the standards in 18.12.b. </span>With respect to (1) above, although all members may participate in discussion, only those members voting with the prevailing side may vote on the adoption of an Answer. Upon the adoption of an Answer <span class="s3">to a Concurring or Dissenting Opinion by the Commission,</span> no further Concurring or Dissenting Opinion shall be permitted; neither shall any amendment to the Concurring or Dissenting Opinion in question be permitted. A Concurring or Dissenting Opinion may be withdrawn.</p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">d. Members may join in pending concurring or dissenting opinions at any time until <span class="s2">the 14-day deadline to request the meeting described in <i>OMSJC</i> 18.12.c.</span></p>
<p class="p29" style="padding-left: 80px;">e. No concurring or dissenting opinion shall be circulated to anyone outside the SJC or the PCA Clerk’s office, until the completion of the procedure described in Section 18.12.c or the passage of the deadline established in 18.12.c in the event no such meeting is requested.</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>18.13</strong> An Executive Session shall be understood to be a meeting or a portion of a meeting wherein only Commissioners, and others specifically invited by the Commission, are present. On the cessation of the Session, only the conclusion, <span class="s5">judgment, or decision shall be made public. The proceeding shall be secret</span> unless the Commission shall vote to remove the injunction of secrecy. (RONR (12th ed.) 9:24-27)</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;">A Closed Session shall be understood as a meeting or portion of a meeting wherein only Commissioners, and others specifically invited by the Commission, are present.<span class="s3">.</span> Unlike an Executive Session, however, the proceedings shall not be secret, but rather discussion of such matters outside of the meeting shall be at the discretion of each commissioner, and the minutes of such a closed session may be read and approved in open session. However, no person present at a closed session shall later identify in any manner the views, speeches or votes of a member of the commission during the closed session, apart from that member’s written permission.</p>
