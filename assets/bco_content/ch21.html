<h4 class="p1"><i>The Ordination and Installation of Ministers</i><i></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>21-1.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>No minister, licentiate or candidate shall receive a call from a church but by the permission of his Presbytery. When a call has been presented to the Presbytery, if found in order and the Presbytery deems it for the good of the Church, they shall place it in the hands of the person to whom it is addressed.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Ordinarily a candidate or licentiate may not be granted permission by the Presbytery to move on to the field to which he has been called, prior to his examination for licensure or ordination. Likewise an ordained minister from another Presbyterian Church in America Presbytery or another denomination, ordinarily shall not move on to the field to which he has been called until examined and received by Presbytery.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>21-2.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>When an intern has completed his internship to the satisfaction of the Presbytery, and has accepted a call, the Presbytery shall take immediate steps for his ordination.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>21-3.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>No Presbytery shall ordain any intern to the office of minister of the Word with reference to his laboring within the bounds of another Presbytery, but shall furnish him with the necessary testimonials, and require him to repair to the Presbytery within whose bounds he expects to labor, that he may submit himself to its authority, according to the Constitution of the Church.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>21-4.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><b>Ordination Requirements and Procedures</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b></p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;">a.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>An intern applying for ordination shall be required to present a diploma of Bachelor or Master from some approved college or university, and also a diploma of Bachelor or Master from some approved theological seminary or authentic testimonials of having completed a regular course of theological studies, or a certificate of completion of and endorsement from a theological study program as approved by the General Assembly and one of the Presbyteries of the Presbyterian Church in America. No Presbytery shall omit any of these educational requirements except in extraordinary cases, and then only with a three-fourths (3/4) approval of the Presbytery. Whenever a Presbytery shall omit any of these educational requirements, it shall always make a record of the reasons for such omission and the parts omitted. The intern shall also present satisfactory testimonials as to the completion and approval of his internship in the practice of the ministry.<span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s2"></span></p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;">b.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><span class="s4">Every candidate for ordination shall ordinarily have met the requirements</span> <span class="s4">of the Assembly&#8217;s approved curriculum. Ordinarily, the intern shall have</span><span class="s5"> </span>been examined in most of the following trials when he was licensed.<span class="s5"> If the Presbytery previously approved all parts of the licensure</span><span class="s2"> examination, it need not re-examine the intern in those areas at this time. If there were areas of weakness, which the Presbytery noted, or if any member of the Presbytery desires to do so, the intern may be examined on particular points again. Additionally, the intern shall be examined on any parts required for ordination which were not covered in his examination for licensure. In all cases, he should be asked to indicate whether he has changed his previous views concerning any points in the <i>Confession of Faith,</i> <i>Catechisms</i>, and <i>Book of Church Order</i> of the Presbyterian Church in America.</span></p>
<p class="p2" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s2"></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>c.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Trials for ordination shall consist of:</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span class="s6">(1)<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span></span>A careful examination as to:</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 120px;">(a)<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>his acquaintance with experiential religion, especially his personal character and family management (based on the qualifications set out in 1 Timothy 3:1-7, and Titus 1:6-9),</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 120px;">(b)<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>his knowledge of the Greek and Hebrew languages,</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 120px;">(c)<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Bible content,</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 120px;">(d)<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>theology,</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 120px;">(e)<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>the Sacraments,</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 120px;">(f)<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Church history,</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 120px;">(g)<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>the history of the Presbyterian Church in America, and</p>
<p class="p6" style="padding-left: 120px;">(h)<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>the principles and rules of the government and discipline of the church.</p>
<p class="p7" style="padding-left: 120px;"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>A Presbytery may accept a seminary degree which includes study in the original languages in lieu of an oral examination in the original languages.</p>
<p class="p7" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span class="s6">(2)<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span></span><span class="s2">He shall prepare a thesis on some theological topic assigned by Presbytery.</span></p>
<p class="p7" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span class="s6">(3)<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span></span><span class="s2">The candidate shall prepare an exegesis on an assigned portion of Scripture, requiring the use of the original language or languages.</span></p>
<p class="p7" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span class="s6">(4)<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span></span>He shall further be required to preach a sermon before the Presbytery or committee thereof, upon three-fourths (3/4) vote.</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>No Presbytery shall omit any of these parts of trial for ordination except in extraordinary cases, and then only with three-fourths (3/4) approval of Presbytery.</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>d.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><span class="s4">Whenever a Presbytery shall omit any of these parts, it shall always make</span> <span class="s7">a record of the reasons for such omissions and of the trial parts omitted.</span></p>
<p class="p8" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>e.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>In the examination of the candidate’s personal character, the presbytery shall give specific attention to potential notorious concerns. Careful attention must be given to his practical struggle against sinful actions, as well as to persistent sinful desires. The candidate must give clear testimony of reliance upon his union with Christ and the benefits thereof by the Holy Spirit, depending on this work of grace to make progress over sin (Psalm 103:2-5, Romans 8:29) and to bear fruit (Psalm 1:3, Gal. 5:22-23). While imperfection will remain, when confessing sins and sinful temptations publicly, the candidate must exercise great care not to diminish the seriousness of those sins in the eyes of the congregation, as though they were matters of little consequence, but rather should testify to the work of the Holy Spirit in his progress in holiness (1 Cor. 6:9-11).</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>f.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>While our Constitution does not require the candidate’s affirmation of every statement and/or proposition of doctrine in our <i>Confession </i><span class="s4"><i>of Faith</i> and <i>Catechisms</i>, it is the right and responsibility of the Presbytery</span> <span class="s4">to determine if the candidate is out of accord with any of the fundamentals</span> of these doctrinal standards and, as a consequence, may not be able in good faith sincerely to receive and adopt the <i>Confession of Faith</i> and <i>Catechisms</i> of this Church as containing the system of doctrine taught in the Holy Scriptures (cf. <i>BCO</i> 21-5, Q.2; 24-6, Q.2).</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>g.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Therefore, in examining a candidate for ordination, the Presbytery shall inquire not only into the candidate’s knowledge and views in the areas specified above, but also shall require the candidate to state the specific instances in which he may differ with the <i>Confession of Faith</i> and <i>Catechisms</i> in any of their statements and/or propositions. The court may grant an exception to any difference of doctrine only if in the court’s judgment the candidate’s declared difference is not out of accord with any fundamental of our system of doctrine because the difference is neither hostile to the system nor strikes at the vitals of religion.</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>h.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The Presbytery, being fully satisfied of his qualifications for the sacred office, shall appoint a day for his ordination, which ought, if practicable, to be in that church of which he is to be the pastor.</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>i.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The extraordinary clauses should be limited to extraordinary circumstances<span class="s7"> of the church or proven extraordinary gifts of the man. Presbyteries should exercise diligence and care in the use of these provisions in order that they not prevent the ordination of a candidate for whom there are truly exceptional circumstances, nor ordain (nor receive from other denominations<i> BCO</i> 13-6) a person who is inadequately prepared for the ministry.</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s7"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>21-5.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span></span>The day appointed for the ordination having come, and the Presbytery being convened, a sermon suitable for the occasion shall be preached by a person appointed or invited by the Presbytery. The Presbytery member appointed to preside shall afterwards briefly recite from the pulpit the proceedings of the Presbytery preparatory to the ordination; he shall point out the nature and importance of the ordinance, and endeavor to impress the audience with a proper sense of the solemnity of the transaction.</p>
