<h2>CHAPTER FOUR</h2>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><i>The Particular Church</i></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>4-1</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>A particular church consists of a number of professing Christians, with their children, associated together for divine worship and godly living, agreeable to the Scriptures, and submitting to the lawful government of Christ&#8217;s kingdom.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>4-2.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Its officers are its teaching and ruling elders and its deacons.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>4-3.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Its jurisdiction, being a joint power, is lodged in the church Session, which consists of its pastor, pastors, its associate pastor(s) and its ruling elders.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>4-4.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The ordinances established by Christ, the Head, in His Church are prayer; singing praises; reading, expounding and preaching the Word of God; administering the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord&#8217;s Supper; public solemn fasting and thanksgiving; catechizing; making offerings for the relief of the poor and for other pious uses; and exercising discipline; the taking of solemn vows, and the ordination to sacred office.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>4-5.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Churches without teaching elders ought not to forsake the assembling of themselves together, but should be convened by the Session on the Lord&#8217;s Day, and at other suitable times, for prayer, praise, the presenting and expounding of the Holy Scriptures, and exhortation, or the reading of a sermon of some approved minister. In like manner, Christians whose lot is cast in destitute regions ought to meet regularly for the worship of God.</p>
