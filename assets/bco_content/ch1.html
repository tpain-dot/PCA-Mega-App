<h4 class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><i>The Doctrine of Church Government</i></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>1-1.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The scriptural form of church government, which is representative or presbyterian, is comprehended under five heads: a. The Church; b. Its members; c. Its officers; d. Its courts; e. Its orders.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>1-2.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The Church which the Lord Jesus Christ has erected in this world for the gathering and perfecting of the saints is His visible kingdom of grace, and is one and the same in all ages.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>1-3.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The members of this visible Church catholic are all those persons in every nation, together with their children, who make profession of their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and promise submission to His laws.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>1-4.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The officers of the Church, by whom all its powers are administered, are, according to the Scriptures, teaching and ruling elders and deacons.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>1-5.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Ecclesiastical jurisdiction is not a several, but a joint power, to be exercised by presbyters in courts. These courts may have jurisdiction over one or many churches, but they sustain such mutual relations as to realize the idea of the unity of the Church.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>1-6.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The ordination of officers is ordinarily by a court, except in the case of ordination by a presbytery&#8217;s evangelist (see <i>BCO</i> 8-6).</p>
<p class="p1"><b>1-7.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>This scriptural doctrine of Presbytery is necessary to the perfection of the order of the visible Church, but is not essential to its existence.</p>
