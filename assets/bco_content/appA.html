<h4 class="p3" style="text-align: left;"><em>MARRIAGE SERVICE</em></h4>
<p class="p5">Whether the marriage is in the church or in a private house, the betrothed shall present themselves attended by witnesses, the man having the woman at his left hand, before the minister, who shall say:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1"><b>The Lord bless you, and keep you; the Lord make His face shine upon you, and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up His countenance upon you, and give you peace (Numbers 6:24-26).</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1"><b>If any here present can show just cause why these persons may not lawfully be joined together in marriage, let them now speak, or hereafter forever hold their peace.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1"><b>Marriage is a divine ordinance instituted for the promotion of man’s happiness and the glory of God. The sacredness of the relation is revealed by the fact that the Holy Spirit has selected it as an apt emblem of the union existing between our Lord and His bride, the Church. Hence, beloved friends, take heed to the exhortation of the inspired apostle, “Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church, and gave Himself for it” (Ephesians 5:26). “Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord” (Ephesians 5:22). The happiness contemplated by this union is realized only by those who fully appreciate its sacredness and are faithful in the performance of the mutual obligations growing out of it, and seek daily God’s blessing.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1"><b>And now as you enter into this new relation, consecrated by heaven’s benediction and hallowed by all that is tenderest and truest in human affection, I entreat you both to join with me in the prayer that God may bless this union, and sanctify it to the furtherance of your good and to the glory of His most holy Name.</b></span></p>
<p class="p5">The Prayer</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Most gracious God, fountain of life and love and joy, look with merciful favor upon these your servants now to be joined in holy wedlock, and enable them ever to remember and truly keep the vows which they make as they enter into covenant with one another and with you, in accordance with the Holy Word, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p5">The Covenant</p>
<p class="p5">Here the parties join their right hands, and the minister says:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Do you, M&#8211;, take N&#8211;, whom you now hold by the hand to be your lawful and wedded wife, and do you promise in the presence of God and these witnesses to be to her a faithful, loving and devoted husband, so long as you both shall live?</b></p>
<p class="p5">The man answers:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>I do.</b></p>
<p class="p5">The minister shall say:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Do you, N&#8211;, take M&#8211;, whom you now hold by the hand to be your lawful and wedded husband and do you promise in the presence of God and these witnesses to be to him a faithful, loving and obedient wife, so long as you both shall live?</b></p>
<p class="p5">The woman answers:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>I do.</b></p>
<p class="p5">If a ring is given and received, the minister shall say:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Let this ring be the token of your plighted faith, and the memorial of your mutual and unending love.</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p5">Then the minister, addressing himself to the company present, says:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Forasmuch as these persons have covenanted together in marriage in accordance with the laws of the commonwealth, I do now pronounce them husband and wife, after the ordinance of God. “Therefore, what God has joined together, let not man separate” (Matthew 19:6).</b></p>
<p class="p5">The Prayer</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Almighty and ever blessed God, our heavenly Father, place the seal of your loving approval upon the union of these two hearts and lives in the sacred bonds of matrimony. Enable your servants, by the gift of thy sufficient grace to be faithful in keeping the vows they have now assumed. Whether in prosperity or in adversity, in sickness or in health, in sorrow or in joy, may their love and sympathy for each other never fail. Into your holy keeping we now commit them, praying that they may ever live “as being heirs together of the grace of life” (1 Peter 3:7). For Jesus’ sake. Amen.</b></p>
<p class="p5">Benediction</p>
<p class="p5">Then the married pair standing, or kneeling, the minister shall pronounce the benediction:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost, bless, preserve, and keep you; the Lord mercifully with his favor look upon you, and so fill you with his grace that you may live faithfully together in this life and in the world to come may have life everlasting. Amen.</b></p>
