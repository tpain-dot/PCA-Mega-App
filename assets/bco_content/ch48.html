<h2>CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT</h2>
<h4 class="p1"><i>The Sanctification of the Lord’s Day</i><i></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>48-1</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>“The fourth commandment requireth the keeping holy to God such set times as he hath appointed in his word; expressly one whole day in seven, to be a holy sabbath to himself.” (<i>WSC</i> 58).</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>48-2</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>God commanded His Old Testament people to keep holy the last day of the week, but He sanctified the first day as the Sabbath by the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ from the dead. For this reason the Church of the new dispensation has from the time of the apostles kept holy the first day of the week as the Lord’s Day.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>48-3</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>It is the duty of every person to remember the Lord’s Day; and to prepare for it before its approach. All worldly business should be so ordered, and seasonably laid aside, as that they may not be hindered thereby from sanctifying the Sabbath, as the Holy Scriptures require.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>48-4</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The whole day is to be kept holy to the Lord; and to be employed in the public and private exercises of religion. Therefore, it is requisite, that there be a holy resting, all the day, from unnecessary labors; and an abstaining from those recreations which may be lawful on other days; and also, as much as possible, from worldly thoughts and conversation.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>48-5</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Let the provisions for the support of the family on that day be so ordered that others be not improperly detained from the public worship of God, nor hindered from sanctifying the Sabbath.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>48-6</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Let every person and family, in the morning, by secret and private prayer, for themselves and others, especially for the assistance of God to their minister, and for a blessing upon his ministry, by reading the Scriptures, and by holy meditation, prepare for communion with God in his public ordinances.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>48-7</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Let the time not used for public worship be spent in prayer, in devotional reading, and especially in the study of the Scriptures, meditation, catechising, religious conversation, the singing of psalms, hymns, or spiritual songs; visiting the sick, relieving the poor, teaching the ignorant, holy resting, and in performing such like duties of piety, charity, and mercy.</p>
