<p class="p47">*Section 107 of the Internal Revenue Code allows a minister to exclude a housing allowance from their taxable salary for eligible housing related expenses (i.e., mortgage payment, rent payments, utilities, etc.). It is important to note that the housing allowance is excludable for income tax purposes only (e.g., federal, and most states). It is not excludable for Self-Employment tax purposes (i.e., SECA) which are paid into the Social Security and Medicare system. <span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p43">A minister’s total cash salary can be broken down into two parts: 1) Taxable Salary and 2) Housing Allowance (Partially Taxable Salary).</p>

<p class="p43">** There is an annual limit on the amount of total contributions (i.e., employee and employer contributions) that can be made to a 403(b) plan. This limit is referred to as the 415(c) limit. However, it is important to note that a minister’s housing allowance cannot be included as part of includible compensation because it is not a component of a minister’s gross income (1.425-2(d) of income tax regulations). This limit may reduce the amount that can be contributed to a retirement account even though the call package guidelines formula includes it (i.e., retirement contributions are a percentage of salary and housing allowance).</p>
<p class="p44">*** Health Savings Account requires a high deductible heath savings account eligible plan.</p>
