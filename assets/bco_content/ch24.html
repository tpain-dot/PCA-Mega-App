<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</h2>
<h4 class="p1"><i>Election, Ordination and Installation of Ruling Elders and Deacons</i><i></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>Election</b></p>
<p class="p4"><b>24-1</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><span class="s1">Every church shall elect persons to the offices of ruling elder and deacon in the following manner: At such times as determined by the Session, communicant members of the congregation may submit names to the Session, keeping in mind that each prospective officer should be an active male member who meets the qualifications set forth in 1 Timothy 3 and Titus 1.</span> Nominees for the office of ruling elder and/or deacon shall receive instruction in the <span class="s1">qualifications and work of the office. Each nominee shall be </span>examined in:</p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;">a.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>his Christian experience, especially his personal character and family management (based on the qualifications set out in 1 Timothy 3:1-7 and Titus 1:6-9),</p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;">b.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>his knowledge of Bible content,</p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;">c.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>his knowledge of the system of doctrine, government, discipline <span class="s2">contained in the Constitution of the Presbyterian Church in America</span> (<i>BCO</i> Preface III, The Constitution Defined),</p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;">d.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>the duties of the office to which he has been nominated, and</p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;">e.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>his willingness to give assent to the questions required for ordination. (<i>BCO</i> 24-6).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>In the examination of the nominee’s personal character, the Session shall give specific attention to potential notorious concerns. Careful attention must be given to his practical struggle against sinful actions, as well as to persistent sinful desires. The nominee must give clear testimony of reliance upon his union with Christ and the benefits thereof by the Holy Spirit, depending on this work of grace to make progress over sin (Psalm 103:2-5, Romans 8:29) and to bear fruit (Psalm 1:3, Gal. 5:22-23). While imperfection will remain, when confessing sins and sinful temptations publicly, the nominee must exercise great care not to diminish the seriousness of those sins in the eyes of the congregation, as though they were matters of little consequence, but rather should testify to the work of the Holy Spirit in his progress in holiness (1 Cor. 6:9-11).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Notwithstanding the above, the</span> Session may render a decision on Christian experience at any point in the process, and based on that decision, may judge him ineligible for that election.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>If there are candidates eligible for the election, the Session shall </span>report to the congregation those eligible, giving at least thirty (30) days prior notice of the time and place of a congregational meeting for elections.</p>
<p class="p9">
<p class="p4"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><span class="s1">If one-fourth (1/4) of the persons entitled to vote shall at any time request the Session to call a congregational meeting for the purpose of electing </span><span class="s1">additional officers, it shall be the duty of the Session to call such a meeting on the above procedure. The number of officers to be elected shall be determined by the congregation after hearing the Session’s recommendation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>24-2</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The pastor is, by virtue of his office, moderator of congregational meetings. If there is no pastor, the Session shall appoint one of their number to call the meeting to order and to preside until the congregation shall elect their presiding officer, who may be a minister or ruling elder of the Presbyterian Church in America or any male member of that particular church.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p4"><b>24-3</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><span class="s4">All communing members in good and regular standing, but no others, are entitled to vote in the election of church officers in the churches to which they respectively belong. A majority vote of </span><span class="s3">votes cast (excluding blanks and abstentions) </span><span class="s4">is required for election.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s4"></span></p>
<p class="p4"><b>24-4</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The voters being convened, the moderator shall explain the purpose of the meeting and then put the question:</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 80px;"><b>Are you now ready to proceed to the election of additional ruling elders (or deacons) from the slate presented?</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>If they declare themselves ready, the election may proceed by private ballot without nomination. In every case a majority of all the <span class="s3">votes cast (excluding blanks and abstentions)</span> shall be required to elect.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p4"><b>24-5.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span></b><span class="s2">On the election of a ruling elder or deacon, if it appears that a large minority of the voters are averse to a candidate, and cannot be induced to concur in the choice, the moderator shall endeavor to dissuade the majority from prosecuting it further; but if the electors are nearly or quite unanimous, or if the majority insist upon their right to choose their officers, the election shall stand.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ordination and Installation</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p4"><b>24-6</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The day having arrived, and the Session being convened in the presence of the congregation, a sermon shall be preached after which the presiding minister shall state in a concise manner the warrant and nature of the office of ruling elder, or deacon, together with the character proper to be sustained and the duties to be fulfilled. Having done this, he shall propose to the candidate, in the presence of the church, the following questions, namely:</p>
<p class="p10">
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 80px;"><b>1.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Do you believe the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, as originally given, to be the inerrant Word of God, the only infallible rule of faith and practice?</b></p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 80px;"><b>2.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Do you sincerely receive and adopt the <i>Confession of Faith</i> and the <i>Catechisms</i> of this Church, as containing the system of doctrine taught in the Holy Scriptures; and do you further promise that if at any time you find yourself out of accord with any of the fundamentals of this system of doctrine, you will, on your own initiative, make known to your Session the change which has taken place in your views since the assumption of this ordination vow?</b></p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 80px;"><b>3.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Do you approve of the form of government and discipline of the Presbyterian Church in America, in conformity with the general principles of biblical polity?</b></p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 80px;"><b>4.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Do you accept the office of ruling elder (or deacon, as the case may be) in this church, and promise faithfully to perform all the duties thereof, and to endeavor by the grace of God to adorn the profession of the Gospel in your life, and to set a worthy example before the Church of which God has made you an officer?</b></p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 80px;"><b>5.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Do you promise subjection to your brethren in the Lord?</b></p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 80px;"><b>6.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Do you promise to strive for the purity, peace, unity and edification of the Church?</b></p>
<p class="p11"><b></b></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s5"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span></span>The<span class="s5"> </span>ruling elder or deacon elect having answered in the affirmative, the minister shall address to the members of the church the following question:</p>
<p class="p11">
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 80px;"><b>Do you, the members of this church, acknowledge and receive this brother as a ruling elder (or deacon), and do you promise to yield him all that honor, encouragement and obedience in the Lord to which his office, according to the Word of God and the Constitution of this Church, entitles him?</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s5"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span></span>The members of the church having answered this question in the affirmative, by holding up their right hands, the candidate shall then be set apart, with prayer by the minister or any other Session member and the laying on of the hands of the Session, to the office of ruling elder (or deacon). Prayer being ended, the members of the Session (and the deacons, if the case be that of a deacon) shall take the newly ordained officer by the hand, saying in words to this effect:</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 80px;"><b>We give you the right hand of fellowship, to take part in this office with us. </b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The minister shall then say:</p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span class="s1"><b>I now pronounce and declare that </b></span><span class="s6"><b>____________________ </b></span><span class="s1"><b>has been regularly elected, ordained and installed a ruling elder (or deacon) </b></span><span class="s1"><b>in this church, agreeable to the Word of God, and according to the Constitution of the Presbyterian Church in America; and that as such he is entitled to all encouragement, honor and obedience in the Lord: In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>After which the minister or any other member of the Session shall give to the ruling elder (or deacon) and to the church an exhortation suited to the occasion.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p4"><b>24-7</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Ordination to the offices of ruling elder or deacon is perpetual; nor can such offices be laid aside at pleasure; nor can any person be degraded from either office but by deposition after regular trial; yet a ruling elder or deacon may have reasons which he deems valid for being released from the active duties of his office. In such a case the Session, after conference with him and careful consideration of the matter, may, if it thinks proper, accept his resignation and dissolve the official relationship which exists between him and the church.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The ruling elder or deacon, though chargeable with neither heresy nor immorality, may become unacceptable in his official capacity to a majority of the church which he serves. In such a case the church may take the initiative by a majority vote at a regularly called congregational meeting, and request the Session to dissolve the official relationship between the church and the officer without censure. The Session, after conference with the ruling elder or deacon, and after careful consideration, may use its discretion as to dissolving the official relationship. In either case the Session shall report its action to the congregation. If the Session fails or refuses to report to the congregation within sixty (60) days from the date of the congregational meeting or if the Session reports to the congregation that it declined to dissolve such relationship, then any member or members in good standing may file a complaint against the Session in accordance with the provisions of <i>BCO</i> 43.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p4"><b>24-8.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>When a ruling elder or deacon who has been released from his official relation is again elected to his office in the same or another church, he shall be installed after the above form with the omission of ordination.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p4"><b>24-9</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>When a ruling elder or deacon cannot or does not for a period of one year perform the duties of his office, his official relationship shall be dissolved by the Session and the action reported to the congregation.</p>
<p class="p9">
<p class="p4"><b>24-10</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>When a deacon or ruling elder by reason of age or infirmity desires to be released from the active duties of the office, he may at his request and with the approval of the Session be designated deacon or elder emeritus. When so designated, he is no longer required to perform the regular duties of his office, but may continue to perform certain of these duties on a voluntary basis, if requested by the Session or a higher court. He may attend Diaconate or Session meetings, if he so desires, and may participate fully in the discussion of any issues, but may not vote.</p>
