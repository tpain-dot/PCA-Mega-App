<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</h2>
<h4 class="p1"><i>The Pastoral Relations</i><i></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>22-1.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The various pastoral relations are pastor, associate pastor, and assistant pastor.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>22-2.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The pastor and associate pastor are elected by the congregation using the form of call in <i>BCO</i> 20-6. <span class="s1">An existing assistant pastor may be elected by the congregation as an associate pastor at the recommendation of the Session without the election of a pulpit committee. </span>Being elected by the congregation, they become members of the Session.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>22-3.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>An assistant pastor is called by the Session, by the permission and approval of Presbytery, under the provisions of <i>BCO</i> 20-1 and 13-2, with Presbytery membership being governed by the same provisions that apply to pastors. He is not a member of the Session, but may be appointed on special occasions to moderate the Session under the provisions of <i>BCO</i> 12-4.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>22-4.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The relationship of the associate pastor to the church is determined by the congregation. The relationship of the assistant pastor to the church is determined by the Session. The dissolution of the relationship of both is governed by the provision of <i>BCO</i> 23.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>22-5.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>In order to provide necessary changes in pastorates, a temporary relation may be established between a church and a minister called Stated Supply. If a church is unable to secure a regular pastor or a Stated Supply, then the Session with approval of Presbytery may establish a temporary relation between the church and a licentiate called Student Supply or Ruling Elder Supply.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>22-6.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Such temporary relationships can take place at the invitation of the church Session to the minister of the Word, the licentiate, or the ruling elder. The length of the relationship will be determined by the Session and the minister, the licentiate, or the ruling elder, with the approval of the Presbytery. Stated supply, student supply, or ruling elder supply relationships will be for no longer than one year, renewable at the request of the Session and at the review of the Presbytery. (See also <i>BCO</i> 19-1).</p>
