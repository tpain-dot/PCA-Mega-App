<h2>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h2>
<h4 class="p1"><i>The Presbytery</i><i></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>13-1</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The Presbytery consists of all the teaching elders and churches within its bounds that have been accepted by the Presbytery. When the Presbytery meets as a court it shall comprise all teaching elders and ruling elders as elected by their Session. Each congregation is entitled to two (2) ruling elder representatives for the first 350 communing members or fraction thereof, and one additional ruling elder for each additional 500 communing members or fraction thereof.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>13-2</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>A minister shall be required to hold his membership in the Presbytery within whose geographical bounds he resides, unless there are reasons which are satisfactory to his Presbytery why he should not do so. When a minister labors outside the geographical bounds of, or in a work not under the jurisdiction of his Presbytery, at home or abroad, it shall be only with the full concurrence of and under circumstances agreeable to his Presbytery, and to the Presbytery within whose geographical bounds he labors, if one exists. When a minister shall continue on the rolls of his Presbytery without a call to a particular work for a prolonged period, not exceeding three years, the procedure as set forth in <i>BCO</i> 34-10 shall be followed. A minister without call shall make or file a report to his Presbytery at least once each year.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><em><span style="font-size: small;">[<strong>EDITORIAL COMMENT: </strong>The provision for a minister to hold his membership in the presbytery within whose geographical bounds he resides does not apply to the non-geographical Korean Language Presbyteries as long as the General Assembly mandates their existence.]</span></em></p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>13-3.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Every ruling elder not known to the Presbytery shall produce a certificate of his regular appointment from the Session of the church which he represents.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>13-4.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Any three ministers belonging to the Presbytery, together with at least three ruling elders, being met at the time and place appointed (which may include a teleconference or videoconference place), shall be a quorum competent to proceed to business. However, any Presbytery, by a majority vote of those present at a stated meeting, may fix its own quorum provided it is not smaller than the quorum stated in this paragraph.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The Presbytery, in its discretion, may for itself and its subordinate committees, commissions, adopt rules determining when videoconference or telecommunication arrangements may be used for meetings and regulating how meetings using telecommunications arrangements shall be conducted.</p>
<p class="p5">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>13-5</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Ordinarily, only a minister who receives a call to a definite ecclesiastical</span> work within the bounds of a particular Presbytery may be received as a member of that Presbytery except in cases where the minister is already honorably retired, or in those cases deemed necessary by the Presbytery, subject to the review of the General Assembly. In such cases deemed necessary, which may include the case of a minister without call whose circumstances appear to require relocation within the bounds of that Presbytery, the time allotment of <i>BCO</i> 13-2 shall be counted from the day the minister was first continued on the roll without call in any Presbytery.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>13-6. </strong>Ministers Transferring into the Presbytery</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;">a.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>A Minister seeking admission to a Presbytery from another Presbytery in the Presbyterian Church in America shall be examined on Christian experience (including personal character and family management), and also as to his views in theology, the Sacraments, and church government. If the examining Presbytery does not accept the Minister seeking admission, it shall record this fact along with its rationale, if one is adopted, in the minutes, and shall communicate its rationale to his current Presbytery.</p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;">b.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>If an applicant comes from another denomination, the Presbytery shall examine him thoroughly as required by the trials listed in <em>BCO</em> 21-4 and require him to answer in the affirmative the questions put to candidates at their ordination. Ordained ministers from other denominations being considered by Presbyteries for reception may come under the extraordinary provisions set forth in <em>BCO</em> 21-4.</p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;">c.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><span class="s2">In every case, Presbyteries shall require each ordained minister entering the Presbytery to state the specific instances in which he may differ with the <em>Confession of Faith </em>and<em> Catechisms</em> in any of their statements and/or propositions, which differences the court shall judge in accordance with <em>BCO</em> 21-4.f-g (see also <em>RAO</em> 16-3.e.7.a-d).</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">
<p class="p1"><b>13-7</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The Presbytery shall cause to be transcribed, in some convenient part of the book of records, the obligations required of ministers at their ordination, which shall be subscribed by all admitted to membership, in the following form:</p>
<p class="p8">
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 80px;"><b>I, _______________, do sincerely receive and subscribe to the above obligation as a just and true exhibition of my faith and principles, and do resolve and promise to exercise my ministry in conformity thereunto</b><span class="s2"><b>.</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><b></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>13-8</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The Presbytery, before receiving into its membership any church, shall designate a commission to meet with the church&#8217;s ruling elders to make certain that the elders understand and can sincerely adopt the doctrines and polity of the Presbyterian Church in America as contained in its Constitution. In the presence of the commission, the ruling elders shall be required to answer affirmatively the questions required of officers at their ordination.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>13-9</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The Presbytery has power to receive and issue* appeals, complaints, and references brought before it in an orderly manner. In cases in which the <span class="s3"></span>Session cannot exercise its authority, it shall have power to assume original jurisdiction. It has power:</p>
<p class="p1"><em><span style="font-size: small;">* [<strong>Editor&#8217;s note:</strong> &#8220;Issue&#8221; means &#8220;settling the issue of the case.&#8221;]</span></em></p>

<p class="p11" style="padding-left: 40px;">c.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>To establish the pastoral relation and to dissolve it at the request of one or both of the parties, or where the interest of religion imperatively demands it;</p>
<p class="p11" style="padding-left: 40px;">d.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>To set apart evangelists to their proper work; to require ministers to devote themselves diligently to their sacred calling and to censure the delinquent;</p>
<p class="p11" style="padding-left: 40px;">e.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>To see that the lawful injunctions of the higher courts are obeyed;</p>
<p class="p11" style="padding-left: 40px;">f.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>To condemn erroneous opinions which injure the purity or peace of the Church; to visit churches for the purpose of inquiring into and redressing the evils that may have arisen in them; to unite or divide churches, at the request of the members thereof; to form and receive new churches; to take special oversight of churches without pastors; to dissolve churches; to dismiss churches with their consent;</p>

If both Moderator and Stated Clerk are unable to act, any three teaching elders and three ruling elders of at least three different churches shall have power to call a meeting. However, any Presbytery may prescribe in its rules its own requirements for calling a special meeting, provided that those requirements are not less than those stated in this section. Notice of the special meeting shall be sent not less than ten days in advance to each teaching elder and to the Clerk of Session of every church. In the notice, the purpose of the meeting shall be stated, and no business other than that named in the notice is to be transacted.
