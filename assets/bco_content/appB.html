<h4 class="p3"><em>A SECOND MARRIAGE SERVICE</em></h4>
<p class="p5">At the time and place appointed for the solemnization of matrimony, the persons to be married shall take their places before the minister, the man having the woman at his left hand, and all present reverently standing.</p>
<p class="p5">The minister shall say:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s4"><b>Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the presence of God to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s4"><b>Marriage was instituted by God himself in the time of man’s innocency and uprightness. The Lord God said, “It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a helper comparable to him” (Genesis 2:18). Thereupon God created woman of man’s own substance and brought her to the man. Our Lord Jesus Christ honored marriage by His presence at the wedding in Cana of Galilee. And He confirmed it as a divine ordinance and a union not to be severed when He declared, “Therefore, what God has joined together, let not man separate” (Matthew 19:6). Moreover, the apostle Paul set forth the sacred and exalted nature of marriage when he likened it to the mystical union that subsists between Christ and His Church.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s4"><b>The purpose of marriage is the enrichment of the lives of those who enter into this estate, the propagation of the race, and the extension of Christ’s Church to the glory of the covenant God.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s4"><b>Let us reverently hear what the Holy Scriptures teach concerning the duty of husbands to their wives and of wives to their husbands:</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s4"><b>“Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church, and gave Himself for it; that He might sanctify, and cleanse it with the washing of water by the Word. &#8230;So husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies” (Ephesians 5:25-28).</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s4"><b>“Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is head of the wife, as also Christ is the head of the church, and He is the Savior of the body” (Ephesians 5:22-23).</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s4"><b>These two persons are come to be joined in this holy estate of marriage. If any man can show just cause why they may not lawfully be wedded, let him now declare it, or else hereafter forever hold his peace.</b></span></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s4"><b>I require and charge you both that, if either of you knows any cause why you may not be lawfully joined together in matrimony, you do now confess it.</b></span></p>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b> Let us pray:</b></p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Most holy and most merciful Father, at once the God of nature and of grace, creator, preserver and redeemer of mankind, fill these, your servant and your handmaiden, with a sense of the solemnity of the vows they are about to make. May they look to you for your assistance, and enter into these sacred obligations in humble dependence upon your enabling grace. Grant this, O Father, with the forgiveness of our sins, through Jesus Christ, your Son. Amen.</b></p>
<p class="p5">After prayer the minister shall say:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Who gives this woman to be married to this man?</b></p>
<p class="p5">The father of the woman, or someone in his stead, shall place her right hand in that of the minister, and the minister shall cause the man to take with his right hand the right hand of the woman.</p>
<p class="p5">The minister shall then say:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>M&#8211;, will you have this woman to be your wedded wife, to live with her after God’s commandments in the holy estate of marriage? And will you love her, honor and cherish her, so long as you both shall live?</b></p>
<p class="p5">The man shall answer:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>I will.</b></p>
<p class="p17">Then the minister shall say:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>N&#8211;, will you have this man to be your wedded husband, to live with him after God’s commandments in the holy estate of marriage? And will you love him, cherish and obey him, so long as you both shall live?</b></p>
<p class="p5">The woman shall answer:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>I will.</b></p>
<p class="p5">The man shall say:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>I, M&#8211;, take you, N&#8211;, to be my wedded wife, and I do promise and covenant before God and these witnesses to be your loving and faithful husband in sickness and in health, in plenty and in want, in joy and in sorrow, as long as we both shall live.</b></p>
<p class="p5">The woman shall say:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>I, N&#8211;, take you, M&#8211;, to be my wedded husband, and I do promise and covenant before God and these witnesses to be your loving and faithful wife in sickness and in health, in plenty and in want, in joy and in sorrow, as long as we both shall live.</b></p>
<p class="p5">The man shall then put the ring on the third finger of the woman’s left hand, and shall say after the minister:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>This ring I give you as a symbol and pledge of constant faith and abiding love.</b></p>
<p class="p5">The minister shall say to the woman:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Do you, N&#8211;, receive this ring as a token of your pledge to keep this covenant and perform these vows?</b></p>
<p class="p5">The woman shall say:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>I do.</b></p>
<p class="p5">The minister shall say:</p>
<p class="p9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Let us pray.</b></p>
<p class="p5">After prayer the minister shall say:</p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By virtue of the authority committed unto me by the church of Christ and the law of the state, I now pronounce you, M&#8211;, and N&#8211;,</span> husband and wife, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</p>
