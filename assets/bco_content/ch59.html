<h2>CHAPTER FIFTY-NINE</h2>
<h4 class="p1"><i>The Solemnization of Marriage</i><i></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>59-1</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Marriage is a divine institution though not a sacrament, nor peculiar to the Church of Christ. It is proper that every commonwealth, for the good of society, make laws to regulate marriage, which all citizens are bound to obey insofar as they do not transgress the laws of God (Acts 5:29).</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>59-2</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Christians should marry in the Lord; therefore it is fit that their marriage be solemnized by a lawful minister, that special instruction be given them, and suitable prayers offered, when they enter into this relation.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>59-3</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Marriage is only to be between one man and one woman (Gen. 2:24, 25; Matt. 19:4-6, 1 Cor. 7:2), in accordance with the Word of God. Therefore, ministers in the Presbyterian Church in America who solemnize marriages shall only solemnize marriages between one man and one woman.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>59-4</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The parties should be of such years of discretion as to be capable of making their own choice; and if they be under age, or live with their parents, the consent of the parents or others, under whose care they are, should be previously obtained, and well certified to the minister before he proceeds to solemnize the marriage.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>59-5</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Parents should neither compel their children to marry contrary to their inclinations, nor deny their consent without just and important reasons.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>59-6</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Marriage is of a public nature. The welfare of civil society, the happiness of families, and the credit of Christianity, are deeply interested in it. Therefore, the purpose of marriage should be sufficiently published a proper time previously to the solemnization to it. It is enjoined on all ministers to be careful that, in this matter, they obey the laws of the community to the extent that those laws do not transgress the laws of God as interpreted by the Constitution of the Presbyterian Church in America; and that they may not destroy the peace and comfort of families, ministers should be assured that, with respect to the parties applying to them, no just objections lie against their marriage.</p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><b>59-7</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The minister should keep a proper register of the names of all persons whom he marries, and of the time of their marriage, for the perusal of all whom it may concern.</p>
