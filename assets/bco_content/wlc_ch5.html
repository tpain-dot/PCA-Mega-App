<p class="p1"><b>Q. 30.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Doth God leave all mankind to perish in the estate of sin and misery?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>God doth not leave all men to perish in the estate of sin and misery, into which they fell by the breach of the first covenant, commonly called the covenant of works; but of his mere love and mercy delivereth his elect out of it, and bringeth them into an estate of salvation by the second covenant, commonly called the covenant of grace.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 31.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>With whom was the covenant of grace made?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The covenant of grace was made with Christ as the second Adam, and in him with all the elect as his seed.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 32.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>How is the grace of God manifested in the second covenant?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The grace of God is manifested in the second covenant, in that he freely provideth and offereth to sinners a Mediator, and life and salvation by him; and requiring faith as the condition to interest them in him, promiseth and giveth his Holy Spirit to all his elect, to work in them that faith, with all other saving graces; and to enable them unto all holy obedience, as the evidence of the truth of their faith and thankfulness to God, and as the way which he hath appointed them to salvation.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 33.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Was the covenant of grace always administered after one and the same manner?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The covenant of grace was not always administered after the same manner, but the administrations of it under the old testament were different from those under the new.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 34.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>How was the covenant of grace administered under the old testament?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The covenant of grace was administered under the old testament, by promises, prophecies, sacrifices, circumcision, the Passover, and other types and ordinances, which did all foresignify Christ then to come, and were for that time sufficient to build up the elect in faith in the promised Messiah, by whom they then had full remission of sin, and eternal salvation.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 35.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>How is the covenant of grace administered under the new testament?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Under the new testament, when Christ the substance was exhibited, the same covenant of grace was and still is to be administered in the preaching of the Word, and the administration of the sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s Supper; in which grace and salvation are held forth in more fullness, evidence, and efficacy, to all nations.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Q. 36.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Who is the Mediator of the covenant of grace?</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A.</b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The only Mediator of the covenant of grace is the Lord Jesus Christ, who, being the eternal Son of God, of one substance and equal with the Father, in the fullness of time became man, and so was and continues to be God and man, in two entire distinct natures, and one person, forever.</p>
