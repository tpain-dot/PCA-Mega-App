<h2>CHAPTER SIXTY</h2>
<h4 class="p1"><i>The Visitation of the Sick</i><i></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><b>60-1</b>.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The power of the prayer of faith is great, and Christians therefore should make entreaty for the sick at the throne of heavenly grace, and should also seek God’s blessing upon all proper means which are being employed for their recovery. Moreover, when persons are sick, their minister, or some officer of the church, should be notified, that the minister, officers and members may unite their prayers in behalf of the sick. It is the privilege and duty of the pastor to visit the sick and to minister to their physical, mental, and spiritual welfare. In view of the varying circumstances of the sick, the minister should use discretion in the performance of this duty.</p>
