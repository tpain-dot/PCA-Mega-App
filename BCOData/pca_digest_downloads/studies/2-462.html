    Two Orders of Elders (Preaching/Teaching Elders, 

    and Ruling Elders): <br />

    A New Testament Study</b><br />

  <br />

        by George W. Knight, III</p>

      <p>Jesus Christ is Lord and Head of the church which is his 

        body. He rules over the church by his Word and Spirit. Through the work 

        of the Spirit he gives to his church men as officers to equip believers 

        for service, so that the church may more faithfully serve Christ in maturity 

        and love (Eph. 4:11ff.). Through his word, the Bible, he specifies the 

        qualifications and duties of those men so that his people may recognize, 

        elect, and appoint such men, and acknowledge Christ's rule in and through 

        them (1 Tim. 3; Titus 1). In this way, God's Word, the Scriptures, provides 

        the description of the offices (or officers) that Christ gives his church, 

        and serves as the only infallible guide for the church in recognizing 

        those offices and those who serve in them. <br />

        <br />

        The Scripture not only lays down the qualifications of such servants, 

        but also gives them descriptive titles or designations and indicates the 

        functions that they are to fulfill in the church. In so designating these 

        offices by specific titles or designations, and also by differentiated 

        functions, the Scripture provides for the church the answer to the question: 

        What offices does Christ continue to give to the church and how many are 

        there? <br />

        <br />

        The answer to this question has varied in the history of the Christian 

        Church and also more particularly in that manifestation of the church 

        called Presbyterian. Among the latter, the answers have tended to gravitate 

        to one of two conclusions: (1) a three-office view, i.e., clergy distinguished 

        from lay ruling officers (elders) and deacons (lay serving officers); 

        and (2) a two-office view, i.e., elders (teaching and ruling, clergy and 

        lay), and deacons (lay serving officers). Proponents of each view have 

        been vigorous in their advocacy and extreme polarizations have resulted. 

        On the one hand, some three-office advocates have stated that the references 

        to elders or bishops in the New Testament apply only to ministers and 

        not to &quot;ruling elders&quot; at all who are then found only in the reference 

        to &quot;helps&quot; and/or &quot;administrations&quot; (or &quot;governments&quot;) in 1 Corinthians 

        12:28 and that their responsibility is limited to ruling or administration 

        and does not include any form of teaching. On the other hand, some two-office 

        advocates have stated that there is no distinction within the office of 

        elder at all, such as is commonly designated by teaching elder and ruling 

        elder, or by minister and ruling elder. <br />

        <br />

        The basis for these two answers in the pages of the New Testament is not 

        hard to find. It is that the New Testament both uses two titles only to 

        describe or designate the officers (cf. Phil 1:1; 1 Tim. 3:1, 2, 8 and 

        12) and also describes these officers by using three functions, i.e., 

        teaching, ruling and serving (cf. 1 Tim. 3:2 (teaching), 5 (ruling or 

        caring) and 13 (serving). The result of this fact is that the elder is 

        spoken of not as having one function, but two, namely, teaching and ruling. 

        The two-office advocates have emphasized the fact that the offices may 

        be designated by two titles only, elders (or bishops) and deacons. The 

        three-office advocates have emphasized the fact that the functions are 

        three-fold and that the offices should correspond to this fact, namely, 

        teachers (ministers), rulers (ruling &quot;elders&quot;) and those who serve (deacons). <br />

        <br />

        It is the thesis of this study, attempting to compare Scripture with Scripture 

        and to harmonize all Scripture truths, that the solution to the seeming 

        dilemma or impasse is to be found in a mutual and complementary recognition 

        of the facts that there are indeed two titles or designations, elders 

        (or bishops) and deacons, but also that within the office of elders there 

        are two functions and that one of those functions, teaching, may be given 

        in a heightened way or as a special gift to some, but not all the elders. 

        Therefore, a distinction may be made within the office of elders designating 

        some as teachers (or ministers) as the New Testament does. This is specially 

        noteworthy in Ephesians 4:11 where within the larger circle of elders, 

        all of whom are undershepherds or pastors, some are further designated 

        as teachers. The study that follows seeks to unfold the Biblical truths 

        and to demonstrate that the thesis proposed is indeed the truth of Scripture. 

        The first portion of the study will unfold the two offices in Scripture, 

        that is, elders (or bishops) and deacons and emphasize that the term elders 

        (or bishops) is used in the plural and embraces all the governors or rulers 

        in the church. The second half of the study will then direct attention 

        to the distinction within the one office of elder and will indicate that 

        there are some who labor in the Word and teaching. Before focusing on 

        these two aspects, a preliminary paragraph will distinguish the continuing 

        offices from those extraordinary and non-continuing offices of apostles 

        and prophets. <br />

        <br />

        It is important to realize that the question, which we naturally ask, 

        &quot;What offices does Christ continue to give to the church and how many 

        are there?&quot; recognizes that Christ does not continually give to the church 

        those special and extraordinary offices of apostles and prophets. The 

        apostles of Jesus Christ are those personally and directly chosen by him 

        (Mk. 3:14; Lk. 6:13; Gal. 1:1), eye-witnesses of his resurrection (Acts 

        1:22; 1 Cor. 15:8-10), and with the prophets are the special recipients 

        of revelation (Eph. 3:5) and thus form the non-repeatable foundation of 

        the church (Eph. 2:20). These two offices, since they have accomplished 

        their unique and non-repeatable functions and tasks, occur only during 

        the foundation days of the church, the New Testament age, and are not 

        now found in the growing and continuing superstructure of the church (cf. 

        1 Peter 2:15ff.). </p>

<p align="center"><strong> I. Two Offices (Elders/Bishops, and Deacons)</strong></p>

      <p>When we move beyond the apostles and prophets, we find that the offices 

        which Christ continues to give his church are sometimes referred to without 

        a specific name or title, but simply by their functions and activities 

        (cf. Heb. 13:7 and 17; 1 Thess. 5:12,13), and sometimes by different words 

        (elders, pastors and teachers, bishops or overseers). But in the midst 

        of this variegated usage, we find two terms (elders or bishops) being 

        used throughout the New Testament, in Acts (11:30; 14;23; 15: 2, 4, 6, 

        22, 23; 16:4; 20:17, 28) and by Paul (Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim. 3:1 and 2; 5:17; 

        Titus 1:5,7), Peter (1 Peter 5:1) and James (5:14), that serve to overarch 

        and include the other terms and the descriptions of functions that relate 

        to oversight. On two occasions we find the term deacons used alongside 

        of this pervasive use of elders/bishops (Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim. 3:12). We thus 

        find three terms used in a more or less technical sense to describe offices. 

        They are elders (<i>presbyteroi</i>), bishops (<i>episkopoi</i>), and 

        deacons (<i>diakonoi</i>). The first two refer to the same group of men 

        and thus are different words for the same office. We can therefore speak 

        of the New Testament as referring to elders or bishops on the one hand 

        and deacons on the other, and thereby grouping the offices into these 

        two categories or functions. <br />

        <br />

        That the two words &quot;elders&quot; and &quot;bishops&quot; refer to the same office is 

        manifest from the following passages (Acts 20:17 and 28; Titus 1:5 and 

        7; and a comparison of 1 Tim 3:lff. and 1 Tim. 5:17). In Acts 20:17 the 

        elders are called from Ephesus to meet with Paul. In Acts 20:28 he designates 

        that same group of elders as bishops or overseers (<i>episkopoi</i>). 

        Paul directs Titus to appoint elders in every city (Titus 1:5) and then 

        goes on to describe those same officers by the term bishops or overseers 

        (Titus 1:7). In 1 Timothy 3:2 Paul uses the term &quot;bishop&quot; to speak of 

        the office of those who teach and rule the church (1 Tim. 3:2 and 5), 

        but then when he returns to the question of remuneration for those who 

        rule and also spend their full time in the occupation of teaching the 

        church, he calls them elders or presbyters (1 Tim. 5:17). In the light 

        of this evidence, we see that with these two terms, elders and bishops, 

        we have two words to designate one and the same group of offices in the 

        church. The one term, elder or presbyter, reflecting particularly the 

        Old Testament background and usage, designates them in reference to their 

        maturity and authority. The other term, bishop or overseer, more common 

        to the Greek-speaking world, designates them in terms of their particular 

        responsibility of having the oversight and care of the church. <br />

        <br />

        These two terms, elders and bishops, serve as the embracing terms which 

        encompass the other designations found in the New Testament for the same 

        activities or functions. This is most evident in 1 Peter 5:1, where even 

        the Apostle Peter is willing to speak of himself as a fellow elder, in 

        view of the fact that he shares with the elders the responsibility for 

        the oversight of the people of God. And this truth is specifically apparent 

        in Acts 15 when the decision is rendered by the apostles and elders acting 

        together and sharing the oversight (15:2, 4, 6, 22, 23; 16:4). Likewise, 

        the ordination or laying on of hands is said to be by the presbytery (1 

        Tim. 4:14), and that includes the Apostle Paul (2 Tim. 1:6), and, furthermore, 

        in Acts 13:1-3 the men who lay on hands are more specifically designated 

        as prophets and teachers. <br />

        <br />

        The officers in the church at Ephesus are referred to as elders or bishops 

        in Acts 20:17, 28 and 1 Tim. 3:1 and 5:17, and as evangelists and pastors 

        and teachers in Eph. 4:11. Both because of what we have seen in the preceding 

        statements, i.e., apostles are fellow elders and prophets and teachers 

        perform the action of presbytery by laying on hands, and because Acts, 

        1 Timothy and Ephesians refer to the same church and the same officers, 

        we may properly infer as a good and necessary consequence that evangelists 

        and pastors and teachers are elders. Certainly the Ephesians passage regards 

        them as leaders who equip the church, a task recognized elsewhere as the 

        particular responsibility of elders (<i>cf</i>. among others, Acts 20:28, 

        1 Tim. 3:4, 5 and 5:17). <br />

        <br />

        When once we have observed that for the New Testament the terms elders 

        and bishops serve as the embracive designation of one particular group 

        of men or office and that another term (<i>diakonos</i>) has become a 

        technical term for the ones who specifically have the task of service 

        in the church, i.e., the deacons, we are impressed by the fact that the 

        New Testament refers to the offices in the church under only these two 

        heads or two offices (Phil. 1:1, 1 Tim. 3:1, 2 and 12; compare Acts 6:1-6). 

        When the Apostle Paul desires to address the officers of the church of 

        Philippi, he does so using two terms and addresses two groups of officers 

        - &quot;the bishops (overseers) and deacons&quot; (Phil. 1:1). In his letter especially 

        written to order the life and government of the church, 1 Timothy (see 

        1 Tim. 3:13), a letter written near the end of his life when church government 

        is evidently settled and fixed, the apostle again speaks of only two groups 

        under these two words, bishops and deacons (1 Tim 3:1 and 2, and 12). 

        Similarly, when the divisions of labor and of functions were accomplished 

        in the early church at Jerusalem in Acts 6:1-6, we find the same two-fold 

        division. The apostles (fellow-elders) continue in the oversight functions 

        of ruling and teaching (Acts 6:2 and 4), while the seven are given the 

        function of service (<i>diakonein</i>) at tables (Acts 6:2 and 3). In 

        summary, we see the New Testament speaking of two offices, bishops (or 

        elders) and deacons (Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim. 3:1 and 2, and 12), and the church 

        of Jesus Christ today should follow that authoritative norm and pattern. <br />

        <br />

        When we ask the distinction between these two offices, we find that the 

        terms used serve themselves to describe that difference. The elders/bishops 

        (overseers) are those who have the spiritual oversight (cf. 1 Peter 5:2, <i>episkopountes</i>), which is specifically said to be ruling and teaching 

        (1 Tim. 3:2 and 5; 5:17; Titus 1:9ff). Such ruling and teaching is not 

        specified for the deacons (<i>diakonoi</i>) in 1 Timothy 3 in a list which 

        in other ways is almost parallel to that for the bishops, but these two 

        functions are clearly omitted (see 1 Tim. 3:8ff). We deduce from Acts 

        6:1-6 that the deacons should continue the practice of those first deacons, 

        the seven, which was to care for the poor and needy and to perform other 

        service ministries for the church under the oversight of the elders (cf. 

        Acts 11:30). When a congregation is first being formed, deacons may be 

        omitted from the officers elected and their functions will be carried 

        on by the elders until that work is too heavy and men are chosen for such 

        diaconal services (Acts 14:23; Titus 1:5ff.; cf. Acts 6:1-6). <br />

        <br />

        The perspective of the New Testament that there are only two permanent 

        and ordinary offices that continue in the church, elders/bishops and deacons, 

        is borne out not only by the fact that these two terms are used to designate 

        all the permanent offices in the New Testament church and thereby place 

        them in only two offices, but also by an awareness of the fact that the 

        elders/bishops are always considered as a group of men who share together 

        those two responsibilities involved in oversight, namely, teaching and 

        ruling. The references to a plurality of elders in every church preclude 

        these references from referring only to those whom we call ministers or 

        preachers today and clearly include those whom we call ruling, as well 

        as teaching, elders. The evidence for this affirmation is set forth in 

        the following paragraphs. <br />

        <br />

        The first churches established by Paul on his first missionary journey, 

        small an persecuted as they may have been, each have a plurality of elders 

        appointed for then (Acts 14:23, &quot;appointed elders for them in every church&quot;). 

        Elders (plural) are called from Ephesus to Miletus and all of them are 

        called overseers (<i>episkopoi</i>) and are given the task of shepherding 

        or pastoring (<i>poimainein</i>, Acts 20:28) the church of God an defending 

        it (Acts 20:30, 31). Like the church at Ephesus, the church at Philippi 

        has a plurality of elders/bishops (Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim. 5:17). As in the 

        case at Ephesus, so also the new congregations on the island of Crete 

        located in the cities are to have a plurality of elders in every city. 

        And, again, like the elders at Ephesus, these elders have their unified 

        oversight function described in the two tasks of teaching and ruling (Titus 

        1:911 and 13). James similarly speaks of calling a group of men designated 

        elders to minister to a particular need in a congregation (James 5:14). 

        Peter also refers to elders in the plural (1 Peter 5:1, notice also all 

        the plural references in verses 2-4) in each of the congregations addressed 

        by his letter (cf. 1 Peter 1:1), and speaks of them as shepherding (<i>poimanate</i>) 

        the particular flock among them (1 Peter 5:2). In I Thessalonians 5 and 

        in Hebrews 13 the elders or bishops are not referred to by such designations, 

        but are referred to in both cases in the plural as a group which has the 

        unified and shared responsibility of teaching and ruling (1 Thess. 5:12, 

        13; Heb. 13:7 and 17). <br />

        <br />

        In all these references to the elders in the plural there is also an emphasis 

        on the fact that they share together as a group the unified and shared 

        responsibility of teaching and ruling, of shepherding and exercising the 

        oversight. So these two truths belong inseparably together. The oversight 

        or shepherding of the church belongs to a plurality of elders and to the 

        plurality of elders belongs the responsibility of oversight and shepherding. 

        That plurality of elders encompasses all the elders known to the New Testament, 

        which can be referred to as teaching elders and ruling elders. <br />

        <br />

        Thus a uniform picture emerges from the New Testament. From the earliest 

        days of the New Testament church to the last letter written by Paul (from 

        Acts 11:30 and 14:23 to 1 Tim. 3:lff., 5:17 and Titus 1:9) and with unified 

        testimony from the various writers (Luke, Paul, Peter, James, the writer 

        of Hebrews), there is agreement that there is one group of men who have 

        the oversight, called elders or bishops, and that this oversight includes 

        both teaching and ruling. Such evidence is an overwhelming testimony to 

        the fact that the oversight of the church is committed into the hands 

        of a group of men called by the New Testament elders/bishops and that 

        their task or function includes both teaching and ruling as one unified 

        and shared responsibility. </p>

      <p align="center"><strong>II. Two Orders of Elders (Preaching/Teaching Elders, and 

        Ruling Elders) </strong></p>

      <p>To this clear evidence for the two offices of elders/bishops and deacons, 

        and the task committed to the elders/bishops should be joined the emphasis 

        upon one function for some, namely teaching, that 1 Timothy 5:17 introduces 

        among those who serve in the office which is there designated by the official 

        term elders (or presbyters). With this passage we have now returned to 

        the two functions found in the one office of elder, namely ruling and 

        teaching, and to the fact that sometimes as here, the one function of, 

        teaching receives particular emphasis. <br />

        <br />

        Although all elders are to be able to teach (1 Tim. 3:2) and thus to instruct 

        the people of God and communicate with those who oppose Biblical teaching 

        (Titus 1:9ff.), the 1 Timothy 5:17 passage recognizes that among the elders, 

        all of whom are to be able to teach, there are those so gifted by God 

        with the ability to teach the Word that they are called by God to give 

        their life in such a calling or occupation and deserve therefore to be 

        remunerated for such a calling and occupation. The relation between the 

        elder especially gifted to teach and all the other elders who are to be 

        able to teach is analogous to but not identical with that of the heightened 

        ability of all the elders compared to that of all believers who are called 

        on to teach one another (Col. 3:16 and Eph. 5:19). That ability to labor 

        in the Word and teaching is described in 2 Tim. 4:1-7 as the ministry 

        which is specifically designated by the phrase &quot;preach the Word.&quot; Those 

        elders especially gifted to teach labor or work hard at their ministry 

        (1 Tim. 5:17) and like the ordinary laborers, they deserve their wages 

        from such labor. Although any elder who devotes his time to the ruling 

        of the church so that it becomes his calling and occupation is worthy 

        not only of the honor of respect, but also the &quot;double honor&quot; of the honorarium 

        or wages, the one whom we designate the teaching elder or the teacher 

        among the elders is especially in view in this passage because such responsibility 

        demands full time service in this calling and occupation. <br />

        <br />

        Once it is recognized that within the office of elder there is a heightened 

        or specialized function of teaching and preaching the Word, the insight 

        has been provided to integrate other passages into our study, especially 

        those which refer to teachers. Although all the references to teachers 

        in the letters of the New Testament do not necessarily refer to those 

        in an office in the church, those that do are most helpful. We have already 

        seen teachers acting as elders in Acts 13:1-3 in laying hands on Paul 

        and Barnabas (cf. 1 Tim. 4:14). Paul in two passages distinguishes the 

        functions which he fulfilled as a minister of Jesus Christ by using the 

        words preacher, apostle and teacher (1 Tim. 2:7; 2 Tim. 1:11). In those 

        passages he is not describing separate and distinct offices, but rather 

        distinguishes the functions of authoritatively announcing the good news 

        (preacher or herald), of being the authoritative eye-witness and spokesman 

        (apostle) and of instructing in the truth (teacher). By separating and 

        distinguishing the functions which he fulfilled as a minister of Jesus 

        Christ, he highlighted each aspect of his unified ministry and calling. <br />

        <br />

        Similarly, when the apostle is considering the manifold gifts of the Holy 

        Spirit in 1 Coronations 12, he distinguishes various gifts or functions 

        relating to offices of the church alongside of and intermingled with other 

        gifts which do not have an office in the church in view (1 Cor. 12:28-31, 

        cf. verses 4ff. especially vs. 7). Apostles and prophets are at one end 

        of the spectrum and refer to offices. Tongues are at the other end of 

        the spectrum and are regarded as a gift without reference to office. <br />

        <br />

        In this list which moves from an official office at one end to an example 

        of an official gift at the other, we find two gifts mentioned which relate 

        to the office of elder, namely, &quot;teachers,&quot; and &quot;administrations&quot; (&quot;governments&quot; 

        KJV) (<i>kuberneiseis</i>) (1 Cor. 12:28, NASB). [The reference to &quot;helps&quot; 

        (<i>antileimpseis</i>) probably is to be related primarily to the deacons 

        whom we see in the seven of Acts 6 performing helpful deeds in serving 

        and caring for widows (Acts 6:1-6).] Here the twofold functions of teaching 

        and ruling are now distinguished and emphasized. And the distinction is 

        given emphasis by referring to the one gift as &quot;teachers&quot; rather than 

        as teaching and by numbering it as third, which puts it only after apostles 

        and prophets. On the other hand, the word used is administrations or governments 

        rather than that of governors, which would more exactly parallel teachers. 

        Administrations is a broader and more general concept. The Greek lexicon 

        of Bauer-Amdt-Gingrich states that &quot;the plural indicates proofs of ability 

        to hold a leading position in the church&quot; (pg. 457). <br />

        <br />

        These observations should not be surprising because these facts are quite 

        in accord with I Timothy 5:17. There we noticed that among the elders, 

        all of whom are to rule, are some &quot;who work hard at preaching and teaching&quot; 

        (NASB). Paul in 1 Corinthians acknowledges the need for the gift of administrations 

        or governments for the rule and oversight of the church. Alongside of 

        that gift he recognizes some with the word teachers who also labor in 

        the Word and teaching (again <i>cf</i>. 1 Tim. 5:17). The word &quot;teachers&quot; 

        must not be regarded as an exclusive reference that separates them from 

        those who have the gift of administrations because we have already seen 

        that Paul can refer to himself as being not only an apostle, but also 

        a preacher and teacher. Since therefore at least two of the gifts in the 

        list in 1 Coronations 12:28-31 can refer to one person, we must not let 

        the fact that the gifts of teachers and administrations are distinguished 

        lead us to think of them erroneously as separate offices. The evidence 

        of the New Testament already considered has demonstrated the unity of 

        the office of elder and the fact that it involves both functions, that 

        is, that of teaching and of ruling (cf. again the passages cited in previous 

        paragraphs of this study). On the other hand, we must give adequate weight 

        to the fact that these functions can be distinguished and emphasized in 

        both 1 Tim. 5:17 and now in 1 Cor. 12:28-31, particularly, the function 

        of teaching. To do justice to such distinction and emphasis we may say, 

        as Dabney has already done, that within the one office or class of elders 

        there are embraced two orders, that of the preaching or teaching elders 

        and that of the ruling elders. Ephesians 4:11 provides in principle further 

        insights into the proper correlation that the distinction brings. <br />

        <br />

        Ephesians 4:11 says &quot;And he gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, 

        and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers&quot; (NASB). The 

        first two groups, apostles and prophets, are the extraordinary and non-repeatable 

        foundation offices, as we have shown earlier. The term evangelists is 

        used only three times in the New Testament. In addition to its occurrence 

        here, Philip, who had been one of the seven of Acts 6 is designated an 

        evangelist (Acts 21:8), and Timothy is urged to do the work of an evangelist 

        (2 Tim. 4:5). The term &quot;evangelists&quot; itself provides the best definition 

        of the work or task of the one in view, namely that he is one who proclaims 

        the evangel, the Gospel. This is a function which may be distinguished 

        from that of the pastors and teachers (Eph. 4:11) and seen as a specialized 

        ministry (Philip, Acts 21:8), but at the same time it is also a function 

        which should mark the ministry and proclamation of all those who like 

        Timothy are called to preach the Word (cf. 1 Tim. 4:15). In view of the 

        fact that the gift of proclaiming the Gospel and planting churches is 

        necessary in the church until the end of the age, this ministry is permanent 

        and not confined to the apostolic period. In view of the fact that evangelists 

        in Eph. 4:11 are in the list of those offices which are distinguished 

        from the saints or believers in general (Eph. 4:12), we may properly regard 

        them as a specialized manifestation of that office whose task is elsewhere 

        described in similar terms to those used here, that of edifying and equipping 

        the saints, namely, the office of elder (Eph. 4:11, 12). <br />

        <br />

        It remains for us to consider the statement &quot;and some as pastors and teachers&quot; 

        (<i>tous de poimenas kai didaskalous</i>). We are aided tremendously in 

        our understanding of the offices referred to in this passage by recognizing 

        that the pastors and teachers in the church at Ephesus are referred to 

        in two other places in the New Testament, namely, Acts 20:17-35 and 1 

        Tim. 3:1-7 and 5:17. It is this triple perspective which throws light 

        on the two terms pastors (<i>poimenas</i>) and teachers (<i>didaskalous</i>). <br />

        <br />

        Let us consider the first word &quot;pastors.&quot; The Greek term means literally 

        &quot;shepherd&quot; and is used in this literal sense in the New Testament of the 

        shepherds at Jesus' birth. Because the people of God are figuratively 

        regarded as sheep, the one who tends, feeds and exercises oversight over 

        them is called the shepherd in a figurative sense. This figurative usage 

        in reference to the religious leaders was already evident in the Old Testament 

        (cf. Jer. 2:8; 3:15; Ezek. 34:2). The figurative usage in reference to 

        religious leaders in the letters of the New Testament is found only here 

        in Eph. 4:11 (Heb. 13:20 and 1 Pet. 2:25 refer to Jesus and the Gospels 

        use it figuratively of Jesus). The solution to the question of what group 

        is in view in the term &quot;pastors&quot; is to be found by recognizing that the 

        shepherding or pastoring responsibility is given to all the elders/bishops 

        in Acts 20:28. &quot;Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock (<i>poimnio</i>), 

        among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd (to feed, 

        KJV) (<i>poimainein</i>) the church of God which he purchased with his 

        own blood&quot; (NASB). The verb used in Acts 20:28 &quot;to shepherd,&quot; &quot;to pastor&quot; 

        (<i>poimainein</i>, also translated &quot;to feed&quot;) is the verbal form of the 

        concept and term we are considering in Eph. 4:11, i.e., &quot;pastors&quot; (<i>poimenas</i>). 

        The Acts passage indicates by this usage that all the elders/bishops have 

        a shepherding or pastoral responsibility and may be designated pastors. 

        When we ask of the Eph. 4:11 passage, who are the pastors?, we may answer 

        from Acts 20:28 and context, they are the elders/bishops. This answer 

        is borne out also by the passage in 1 Peter 5:1-4 which speaks of the 

        task of elders. Here again the task of elders in their collective capacity 

        is described in shepherding or pastoring terms: &quot;shepherd (<i>poimanati</i>) 

        the flock (<i>poimnion</i>) among you&quot; (1 Peter 5:2; cf. verse 3, &quot;the 

        flock&quot;). So we may deduce from the Apostle Peter as well as the Apostle 

        Paul in Luke's account in Acts that pastors equal elders/bishops. And 

        finally, this insight is borne out by the other reference to the elders 

        in Ephesus in 1 Tim. 3:1-7 and 5:17. To take care of the church (1 Tim. 

        3:5) and to rule the church (1 Tim. 5:17) is another way of saying shepherd 

        or pastor the church, and taking care of and ruling the church is presented 

        in 1 Tim. 3:5 and 5:17 as the task of bishops/elders as a whole. We may 

        conclude that the pastors in view in Eph. 4:11 are all the elders/bishops. <br />

        <br />

        We must now turn our attention to the term &quot;Teachers&quot; and its relationship 

        to pastors in Eph. 4:11. In the grammatical construction of the entire 

        statement of Eph. 4:11 each of the positions named has the definite article 

        &quot;the&quot; before it, except for the term teachers. The list would read in 

        a literal translation as follows: &quot;And he gave <i>the</i> apostles, and<i> the </i>prophets, and <i>the</i> evangelists, and<i> the</i> pastors and 

        teachers.&quot; The effect of omitting the definite article &quot;the&quot; before teachers 

        is that it groups pastors and teachers together in one class or category. 

        (In Greek grammars this is called the Granville Sharp rule.) Rather than 

        reading &quot;the pastors, and the teachers,&quot; the statement reads &quot;the pastors-and-teachers.&quot; 

        In effect, we may say that the apostle regards the teachers as belonging 

        to the class or category of pastors. But at the same time, and especially 

        in the light of 1 Cor. 12:28-31, the teachers are a specialized and emphasized 

        order within that larger class. And this is exactly how he has spoken 

        of elders in 1 Tim. 5:17. 1 Tim. 5:17 states that among that larger group 

        of elders, all of whom rule, there are those who labor in the Word and 

        teaching. What the apostle Paul has said in 1 Tim. 5:17 is now said in 

        Eph. 4:11 by the expression &quot;the pastors and teachers.&quot; All elders are 

        pastors. Among the elders, all of whom have a pastoral or shepherding 

        responsibility, there are some who labor in the Word and teaching whom 

        the New Testament calls teachers as here, or as those who preach elsewhere. 

        That pastor/elder is a preaching or teaching pastor/elder. Here again, 

        to use Dabney's terms, we have two orders and one class or office. The 

        one class or office is that of pastor/elder/bishop. The two orders within 

        that one class are teaching or preaching pastors/elders on the one hand 

        and ruling pastors/elders on the other hand. The non-repeated definite 

        article &quot;the&quot; tightly joins the two orders together as one class or office. 

        The word teachers added to that of pastors indicates a specialized ministry 

        among that of the pastors/elders. <br />

        <br />

        Why then was the term &quot;evangelist&quot; separated from that of pastors and 

        teachers? Because the activity of evangelists, as important as it is to 

        the work of the church and the eldership, is not so intrinsically a part 

        of the work of the eldership in reference to its role as pastors of the 

        flock that it should be given as a definite aspect of pastoring as teaching 

        was. To be an elder in reference to the flock is by definition to be one 

        of the pastors of the flock. And pastoring the flock involves of necessity 

        that some at least must labor in the Word and teaching and be teachers. 

        But pastoring the flock does not involve intrinsically evangelists. Evangelists 

        are gaining lost sheep, not caring for saved and gathered ones. So the 

        apostle has placed that aspect of eldership, evangelists, in a separate 

        category and recognizes that some have special gifts for that task. <br />

        <br />

        The New Testament makes a distinction within the one office of elders 

        of some who labor in teaching the Word. The church through the ages has 

        been faithful to the New Testament when it has done the same. When we 

        inquire further about the duties and responsibilities of those among the 

        elders who are laboring in the Word and teaching, the teaching or preaching 

        elders, we must not only return to the passages about elders and bishops 

        in general, but also consider those passages referring to Timothy and 

        to Paul who were involved in this particular aspect as fellow-elders who 

        were laboring in the Word and teaching in the capacity of teaching or 

        preaching elders (cf. 1 Cor. 9; 2 Cor. 3, 4, 5; 1 Tim. 4:6-16; 2 Tim. 

        1:3-14; 2; 3:10-4:8). <br />

        <br />

        Therefore, the church which seeks to be faithful to the New Testament 

        will seek to keep in perspective and balance the unity of the office of 

        elders/bishops, which when joined by the deacons leads the New Testament 

        to speak of the permanent offices of the church as just these two, and 

        also the distinguishing function given to some among the elders by means 

        of a particular gift of teaching and a corresponding activity. This will 

        mean that all the elders rule together and are together responsible for 

        the teaching of the church. It will also mean that of that plurality some 

        will be more gifted by God to teach than the others and therefore in distinction 

        from those others will make that ministry their vocation, whereas the 

        others possessing the same authority will remain in other vocations while 

        they share in the oversight. The unity and parity within the one office 

        of elder helps to foster the mutual submission to one another, which in 

        turn helps to preserve the humble servant quality of the eldership, and, 

        at the same time, the unique Lordship of Christ. The recognition of differing 

        manifestations of gifts, especially in that of teaching, within the unified 

        eldership exalts the sovereignty of Christ's Lordship, who gives gifts 

        as he will for the good of his church, and helps to ensure that that most 

        needed gift of teaching Christ's Word will have full emphasis and free 

        course in his church. By this, his Word of instruction and the enabling 

        of his Spirit, Christ orders and edifies his people, the church, the body 

        of Christ.</p></td>
