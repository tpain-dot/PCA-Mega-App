                    Empowered to Serve</b><br />
  <br />
                  by Robert H. Kirksey</p>
                  <p>A new awareness of the high calling of the eldership is confronting the 
                    Presbyterian Church in America. <br />
                    <br />
                    Sessions and congregations are approaching the election of their elders 
                    with a growing concern for evidence of calling and spiritual qualifications. <br />
                    <br />
                    The <i>Book of Church Order</i>'s provisions regarding the election, ordination 
                    and installation of ruling elders and deacons has focused new attention 
                    on the biblical qualifications for office as found in 1 Timothy 3 and 
                    Titus 1. <br />
                    <br />
                    A rising interest in discipline in the church has also caused many elders 
                    to have a new consciousness that officers of the church should first walk 
                    &quot;blameless before the flock&quot;, themselves, before they can effectively 
                    exercise discipline over others. It is an awkward thing to be involved 
                    in removing a mote from a brother's eye when there is a beam in one's 
                    own eye. <br />
                    <br />
                    New attention to the Bible-based concept of one class of elders has led 
                    many elders to see, some for the first time, that all elders - both teaching 
                    and ruling - are scripturally enjoined to &quot;walk blameless&quot;. The old notion 
                    that the teaching elder should live on the highest possible moral plane, 
                    while the ruling elder is indulged to live at a somewhat lower level of 
                    conduct, will no longer obtain in the light of scriptural truth. <br />
                    <br />
                    Much soul-searching is taking place among ruling elders, some of whom 
                    have served for many years. More and more, ruling elders are asking themselves 
                    these questions: &quot;Am I qualified to fill the office of elder?&quot;; &quot;Am I 
                    holy?&quot;; &quot;Am I a novice?&quot;; &quot;Am I above reproach?&quot;; &quot;Am I able to rule?&quot;; 
                    &quot;Do I desire the office?&quot;; &quot;Am I called to be an elder?&quot;. <br />
                    <br />
                    As elders search for assurance and peace of mind regarding their calling 
                    and qualification, the proper place to start is in humbleness of heart. 
                    We must first acknowledge our basic unworthiness before God, before we 
                    can expect to find the power needed to effectively serve in such a high 
                    calling. <br />
                  </p>
                  <table width="650" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
                    <tr>
                      <td><blockquote>&quot;Have mercy on me, 0 God, a sinner. Holy art Thou, 0 Lord, 
                        and it is against Thee that I have sinned. Cleanse me. Pour out 
                        your blessings on me, 0 God, that I might grow in holiness, unto 
                        the stature of the fullness of Christ. Mold me, 0 God, and use me 
                        as Thou wilt. And then, 0 God, forbid that I should glory, save 
                        in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.&quot;</blockquote></td>

                  </table>
                  <p> As an elder seeks to find himself in relationship to his office, the 
                    scriptures are an invaluable and necessary source of enlightenment. For 
                    instance, in the Third Chapter of Philippians, the Apostle (and elder) 
                    Paul gives us a most appropriate lesson for the elder who truly wants 
                    to grow in holiness. When the elder reads, here, Paul's definition of 
                    his life purpose, he is led to see that this is the answer to his own 
                    inadequacy. </p>
                  <table width="650" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
                    <tr>
                      <td><blockquote>
                        <p>&quot;That I may win Christ, and be found in Him, not having mine 
                          own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through 
                          the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God, by faith 
                          ... That I may know Him and the power of his resurrection.&quot; (Philippians 
                          3). </p>
                      </blockquote></td>
                    </tr>
                  </table>
                  <p>So, the elder begins to see, it is not what he can attain through his 
                    own merits or efforts. No! It is what God can do through him, when life 
                    is yielded to Christ. Then God, through the work of the Holy Spirit, progressively 
                    empowers the elder to live out, in his life, all those noble qualifications 
                    ascribed to his office. <br />
                    <br />
                    To truly &quot;gain Christ&quot;, then, so that the elder might be what an elder 
                    should be, is to learn to depend completely on Christ - not on oneself. 
                    Only then, can the futile and frustrating human struggle to be worthy 
                    be ended. Sanctification can then begin to make progress in one's life. 
                    The will becomes more and more under subjection to the mind of Christ, 
                    which is now filling the whole being. <br />
                    <br />
                    We must remember always that our chief purpose in life is to glorify God 
                    and to enjoy Him forever. Then we can say, with Paul, &quot;Whether ye eat 
                    or drink, or whatever ye do, do all to the glory of God.&quot; (1 Cor. 10:31). <br />
                    <br />
                    As we work hard to be the kind of elder described in 1 Timothy 3 and Titus 
                    1, we must take care that we are not doing it to bring glory to ourselves, 
                    but our purpose must always be, &quot;That God may in all things be glorified.&quot; 
                    (1 Peter 4:11). <br />
                    <br />
                    More and more, then, as elders glorify God in their lives, God in turn 
                    fulfills another of his sure promises - He gives his Holy Spirit to those 
                    who obey Him (Acts 5:32). The elder is empowered by God to fill his office. <br />
                    <br />
                    Throughout the scriptures it is made clear, however, that an expectant 
                    faith is a prerequisite to this filling by the Holy Spirit. Before the 
                    disciples were empowered at Pentecost they were expecting it to happen. 
                    Likewise, we elders must believe that through the power of the Holy Spirit 
                    we shall indeed be enabled to &quot;walk blameless before the flock&quot;. Understanding, 
                    of course, that we will never find total perfection in this life, but 
                    we will be constantly improving. This power enables us to avoid conscious 
                    sinning and premeditated sinning. But, if we expect God's blessing in 
                    our struggle for holiness, we must, like Enoch, first &quot;walk with God&quot;. <br />
                    <br />
                    Another vital means of this empowering is prayer. At Pentecost, the disciples 
                    were praying when the blessing came. We can never expect to find the power 
                    we need if we neglect our prayer life. But our prayers can, in themselves, 
                    be power-producing if we keep our lives clean and holy, our spirits filled 
                    with Christ and our faith high. God gives us this sure promise in His 
                    Word, and it is ours to claim: <br />
                  </p>
                  <table width="650" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
                    <tr>
                      <td><blockquote>
                        <p>&quot;The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.&quot; (James 
                          5: 16b N.I.V.)</p>
                      </blockquote></td>
                    </tr>
                  </table>
                  <p> So there it is - our prayer can produce remarkable results, if we are 
                    living a righteous life. The elder who is feeling ineffective in his office 
                    has it made very plain to him - the power for effective service is available; 
                    but first, he must obey God and live righteously. <br />
                    <br />
                    If we expect God to reward our efforts as elders it also follows that 
                    we must be at work doing those things which the scriptures tell us elders 
                    are supposed to do, like the two most obvious duties - &quot;teaching&quot; and 
                    &quot;ruling&quot;. We understand that only those elders we now call &quot;teaching elders&quot;, 
                    those who have been called to a ministry of the preaching of the Word, 
                    have that &quot;heightened&quot; form of the gift of teaching, known as the preaching 
                    of the Word. But all elders are called to a place of teaching in one form 
                    or another. It may be teaching a Sunday School class or a Bible study 
                    group, delivering an exhortation when a pulpit is vacant, carrying on 
                    a tract ministry, talking with our daily associates about the Lord Jesus 
                    Christ, or perhaps simply living a sermon in our daily walk. Somehow, 
                    though, the elder must teach, if he is to truly fill his office and if 
                    he is to find the full joy attendant with that office. &quot;I Love to Tell 
                    the Story&quot; should be the theme of every elder's life. Another advantage 
                    derived from teaching is that it helps empower us through an intensified 
                    use of God's Word. As we teach, we progressively give our lives over, 
                    more and more, to daily Bible study. We find that we are saying, from 
                    the heart, with the psalmist: </p>
                  <table width="650" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
                    <tr>
                      <td><blockquote>
                        <p>&quot;Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.&quot; (Ps. 
                          119:105); and &quot;Thy words have I hid in my heart that I might not 
                          sin against thee.&quot; (Ps. 119:11). </p>
                      </blockquote></td>
                    </tr>
                  </table>
                  <p>Elders who have been neglecting the teaching function should earnestly 
                    begin seeking God's power to cultivate it; maybe you cannot do it, but, 
                    remember - God can do it through you. Moses knew he was incapable of leading 
                    a nation out of bondage, but God empowered him and used him to accomplish 
                    it. &quot;With God all things are possible.&quot; (Matt. 19:26). <br />
                    <br />
                    As the elder carries out the function of &quot;ruling&quot;, he can be assured of 
                    strengthening and guidance from on high. Jesus' promise, &quot;Lo, I am with 
                    you alway&quot;, is carried out every step of the way as we go forth to serve 
                    him. The &quot;ruling&quot; which the elder is called upon to do is certainly a 
                    means of serving. That word, &quot;ruling&quot;, has a modern-day connotation which 
                    sometimes seems harsh. We tend to think of it as meaning, &quot;commanding&quot;, 
                    and we shy away from such a function. &quot;Governing&quot; would be a better word. 
                    Or &quot;shepherding&quot;. Or &quot;pastoring&quot;. Or &quot;leading&quot;. Those are some of the 
                    things elders are called to do under their function of ruling. Too often, 
                    elders are not willing to shoulder the responsibilities of the ruling 
                    function and excuse themselves with an overdone humility. Christ's church 
                    needs spirit-filled, Bible-wise, praying officers, who are not afraid 
                    to assume the responsibilities of governing in His church. It needs elders 
                    who are ready to minister and under-shepherd in the flock over which God 
                    has given them leadership. Planning and implementing the spiritual development 
                    of the congregation requires officers who are dedicated and tireless in 
                    their work for the Lord. <br />
                    <br />
                    Church discipline is one of the most difficult tasks facing the Session 
                    of any church. Too often, when matters of discipline arise, elders want 
                    to excuse themselves from that unpleasant matter by saying that they do 
                    not feel that they are qualified to pass judgment on another church member. 
                    The remedy for that inadequacy is spiritual development and growth in 
                    holiness on the part of every elder before the matters of discipline arise. 
                    When elders are empowered of God, even the bitter task of discipline can 
                    be carried out in an attitude of love. When the mind of Christ is in each 
                    member of the Session, no task in His Church is too difficult. <br />
                    <br />
                    Yes, this high office of elder can be carried out in an attitude of assurance 
                    and joy. The key is found in that method of purposeful living explained 
                    by Paul to the Philippians: &quot;Gain Christ&quot; - &quot;know Him&quot; - &quot;let this mind 
                    be in you which also was in Christ Jesus&quot; - &quot;for me to live is Christ&quot; 
                    - &quot;for our citizenship is in heaven&quot;. . . Not through our strength, alone, 
                    but through the empowering of the presence of the Holy Spirit in our lives 
                    . . . We, too, can say, &quot;I can do all things through Christ, which strengtheneth 
                    me.&quot; (Philippians 4:13). <br />
                    <br />
                    For those elders who may have become disheartened because of a failure 
                    to reach the state of perfection toward which they have been striving, 
                  Paul brings these words of encouragement: </p>

                      <td><blockquote>
                        <p>&quot;Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of 
                          it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining 
                          toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize 
                          for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.&quot; (Philippians 
                          3:13-14 N.I.V.)</p>

                  </table>
                  <p> Certainly, if the Apostle Paul felt that he was still called on to be 
                    &quot;straining toward what is ahead&quot;, we should take heart when we, too, find 
                    our struggle forward to be difficult at times. <br />
                    <br />
                    As our denomination prayerfully strives to have its elders measure up 
                    to all the scriptural qualifications of the office, let us be kind in 
                    our judgment of those whose spiritual gifts are less than ours. Not all 
                    effective elders will have exactly the same gifts. There may be a man, 
                    sitting as a member of a session who seldom says a word; and yet, God 
                    may have placed him there as a balance, or to set an example of patience 
                    and tolerance for some articulate but impetuous member, who might be inclined 
                    to speak too hastily at times. Or there might be a man who can function 
                    notably as an elder in a small congregation, who might never have been 
                    chosen for the office if he had been in a large church. <br />
                    <br />
                    In Christian charity, let us remember, &quot;Man looketh on the outward appearance, 
                    but the Lord looketh on the heart.&quot; (1 Sam. 16:7). <br />
                    <br />
                    So, empowered by the Holy Spirit, we totally surrender our lives to Christ 
                    and apply our spiritual gifts earnestly, looking forward to that day when 
                    we shall indeed &quot;walk blameless&quot; in a total sense, for our great expectation 
                    is that &quot;when He shall appear, we shall be like Him.&quot; (1 Jn. 3:2). <br />
                    <br />
                    Longing to know that perfect holiness, we say, &quot;Come, Lord Jesus, Come 
                    Quickly!&quot;</p></td>
