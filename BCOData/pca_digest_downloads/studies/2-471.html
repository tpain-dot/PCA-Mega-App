                    Ministers of the Word</b><br />
  <br />
                  by Rev. Donald A. Dunkerley</p>
                  <p align="left">It is the universal conviction of all Reformed churches 
                    since the time of the Reformation that there is within the church, and 
                    indeed among the officers of the church, a distinct group, class or order 
                    of men who have been specially called and anointed by God for the work 
                    of preaching the gospel and administering the Sacraments. These men are 
                    to be given special training, recognized by the church for their gift 
                    and calling, and set apart by the church for the work of preaching. Since 
                    preaching is a distinct work for a distinct class of persons, it requires 
                    a distinct ordination by the church. The men who receive this ordination 
                    are most commonly called Ministers of the Word. They, and they alone, 
                    should be permitted to preach the Word of God in the churches. <br />
                    <br />
                    The ministry of the Word of God is often referred to as an office. There 
                    has been difference of opinion and terminology within Reformed churches 
                    as to the relationship of the office of Minister of the Word with other 
                    officers, particularly the officers of Elder and Bishop. There have been 
                    differences regarding the relationship of the officer of Minister of the 
                    Word of God with the offices of Pastor and Teacher. Pastor and Teacher 
                    are often regarded as separate offices within the office of Minister of 
                    the Word, and Ministers of the Word are often regarded as having a separate 
                    office within the office of Elder. Clearly the word &quot;office&quot; is used in 
                    a variety of senses in the Reformed tradition. <br />
                    <br />
                    But, amidst all the differences of terminology and all of the different 
                    viewpoints, there is one fact that receives universal agreement: the office 
                    or order or class of Ministers of the Word is a distinct body of men, 
                    especially called by God and especially ordained by the church, to whom 
                    alone belongs the prerogatives of preaching the gospel and administering 
                    the Sacraments. <br />
                    <br />
                    In this paper I intend first to look at the order of Ministers of the 
                    Word in the Reformed tradition; second, to examine the scriptural basis 
                    for the conviction that such an order exists; and third, to draw certain 
                    conclusions for the present time. </p>
                  <p align="center"> MINISTERS OF THE WORD IN EARLY REFORMED CONFESSIONS</p>
                  <p align="left"> Many of the Reformed confessions of faith have given specific 
                    attention to the Minister of the Word. The Tetrapolitan Confession, 1530, 
                    written by Martin Bucer, says, &quot;What constitutes fit and properly consecrated 
                    ministers of the Church, bishops, teachers and pastors, is that they have 
                    been divinely sent ('for how will they preach unless they be sent?') - 
                    i.e., that they have received the power and mind to preach the Gospel 
                    and to feed the flock of Christ, and also the Holy Ghost who cooperates 
                    - i.e., persuades hearts.&quot;<a href="#1">[<b>1</b>]</a> It is to be noted 
                    that Ministers of the Church are a specially sent and consecrated group 
                    of men who have received a certain power and mind and gift of the Holy 
                    Ghost. It is also to be noted that Ministers of the Church are to be seen 
                    as embracing three sub-offices: bishops, teachers and pastors. <br />
                    <br />
                    The first Helvetic Confession of 1536, also known as the Second Confession 
                    of Basel, was drawn up by Bullinger and others and was very much influenced 
                    by Bucer and Capito. It says, &quot;We hold that the sacred assemblies and 
                    meetings of believers should be conducted in such a way that above all 
                    else God's Word be placed before the people at a common place and reserved 
                    for that purpose alone; that the mysteries of Scripture be daily expounded 
                    and explained by qualified ministers ... &quot;<a href="#2">[<b>2</b>]</a> It is to be noted that the exposition and explanation of God's Word is 
                    to be central to Reformed worship and that this must be done only by qualified 
                    Ministers. <br />
                    <br />
                    The Lausanne Articles of 1536, written by William Farel, say, &quot;The said 
                    Church acknowledges no ministry except that which preaches the Word of 
                    God and administers the Sacraments.&quot;<a href="#3">[<b>3</b>]</a> <br />
                    <br />
                    The Geneva Confession of 1536 was written by John Calvin, or at least 
                    was written under his strong influence, and follows the same pattern as 
                    the first edition of his<i> Institutes</i>, which appeared in the same 
                    year. The confession contains the following article, headed &quot;Ministers 
                    of the Word:&quot; <br />

                        <p>We recognize no other pastors in the Church than faithful pastors 
                          of the Word of God, feeding the sheep of Jesus Christ on the one 
                          hand with instruction, admonition, consolation, exhortation, deprecation; 
                          and on the other resisting all false doctrines and deceptions 
                          of the devil, without mixing with the pure doctrine of the Scriptures 
                          their dreams or their foolish imaginings. To these we accord no 
                          other power or authority but to conduct, rule, and govern the 
                          people of God committed to them by the same Word, in which they 
                          have power to command, defend, promise, and warn, and without 
                          which they neither can nor ought to attempt anything. As we receive 
                          the true ministers of the Word of God as messengers and ambassadors 
                          of God, it is necessary to listen to them as to Him Himself, and 
                          we hold their ministry to be a commission from God necessary in 
                          the church. On the other hand, we hold that all seductive and 
                          false prophets, who abandon the purity of the Gospel and deviate 
                          to their own inventions, ought not at all to be suffered or maintained, 
                          who are not the pastors they pretend, but rather, like ravening 
                          wolves, ought to be hunted and ejected from the people of God.<a href="#4">[<b>4</b>]</a></p>

                  <p align="left"> The French Confession of Faith, 1559, says, &quot;Now as we 
                    enjoy Christ only through the gospel, we believe that the order of the 
                    Church, established by his authority, ought to be sacred and inviolable, 
                    and that, therefore, the Church can not exist without pastors for instruction, 
                    whom we should respect and reverently listen to, when they are properly 
                    called and exercise their office faithfully.&quot;<a href="../$5">[<b>5</b>]</a> <br />

                    The principal confession of faith of Dutch Reformed Churches and of other 
                    churches from the Low Countries is the Belgic Confession of Faith, 1561, 
                    written by Guido de Bres. Of particular interest to us are articles 30 
                    and 31: </p>

                        spiritual policy which our Lord has taught us in his Word - namely, 
                        that there must be Ministers or Pastors to preach the Word of God, 
                        and to administer the Sacraments; also elders and deacons, who, 
                        together with the pastors, form the council of the Church; that 
                        by these means the true religion may be preserved, and the true

                        these means everything will be carried on in the Church with good

                        Lord, and in that order which the Word of God teacheth. Therefore 
                        every one must take heed not to intrude himself by indecent means, 
                        but is bound to wait till it shall please God to call him; that

                    the Ministers or Pastors have the distinctive work of preaching and administering 
                    the Sacraments. <br />

                    The most comprehensive treatment of the subject of Ministers is to be 
                    found in the Second Helvetic Confession of 1566. The entirety of chapter 
                    18 is, &quot;Of the Ministers of the Church, Their Institution and Duties.&quot; 
                    This chapter is spread out over most of ten pages in the 1966 publication 
                    of <i>Reformed Confessions of the 16th Century. </i><br />
                    <br />
                    The chapter indicates that the Ministers of the New Testament can be found 
                    in several different capacities or offices: <br />

                        <p><i>Ministers of the New Testament</i>. Furthermore, the ministers 
                          of the new people are called by various names. For they are called 
                          apostles, prophets, evangelists, bishops, elders, pastors, and 
                          teachers (1 Cor. 12:28; Eph. 4:11). <i>The Apostles</i>. The apostles 
                          did not stay in any particular place, but throughout the world 
                          gathered together different churches. When they were once established, 
                          there ceased to be apostles, and pastors took their place, each 
                          in his church. <i>Prophets</i>. In former times, the prophets 
                          were seers, knowing the future; but they also interpreted the 
                          Scriptures. Such men are also found still today. <i>Evangelists</i>. 
                          The writers of the history of the Gospel were called Evangelists; 
                          but they also were heralds of the Gospel of Christ; as Paul also 
                          commended Timothy: &quot;Do the work of an evangelist&quot; (2 Tim. 4:5). <i>Bishops</i>. Bishops are the overseers and watchmen of the 
                          Church, who administer the food and needs of the life of the Church. <i>Presbyters</i>. The presbyters are the elders and, as it were, 
                          senators and fathers of the Church, governing it with wholesome 
                          counsel. <i>Pastors</i>. The pastors both keep the Lord's sheepfold, 
                          and also provide for its needs. <i>Teachers</i>. The teachers 
                          instruct and teach the true faith and godliness. Therefore, the 
                          ministers of the church may now be called bishops, elders, pastors, 
                          and teachers.<a href="#8">[<b>8</b>] </a></p>

                  <p align="left"> The confession makes an interesting contrast between the 
                    Priesthood and the Ministry. It says, &quot;The priesthood and the ministry 
                    are very different from one another. For the priesthood, as we have just 
                    said, is common to all Christians; not so is the ministry.&quot;<a href="#9">[<b>9</b>] </a>The doctrine of the priesthood of believers emphatically does not 
                    teach that all believers are Ministers of the Word. <br />
                    <br />
                    The confession indicates, &quot;The duties of ministers are various; yet for 
                    the most part they are restricted to two, in which all the rest are comprehended: 
                    to the teaching of the Gospel of Christ, and to the proper administration 
                    of the Sacraments.<a href="#10">[<b>10</b>]</a> <br />
                    <br />
                    It should be clear from the above that the Reformed confessions of the 
                    sixteenth century were unanimous in their agreement that there was a distinct 
                    order of Ministers who alone had the right to preach and to administer 
                  Sacraments. </p>
                  <p align="center"> MINISTERS OF THE WORD ACCORDING TO THE WESTMINSTER ASSEMBLY<br />
                  </p>
                  <p align="left"> The preaching of the Word of God has a distinctive role 
                    in the salvation of the individual, according to Reformed theology, and 
                    especially according to the understanding of the Westminster Assembly 
                    of Divines. In their answer to Larger Catechism question 155, they say, 
                    &quot;The Spirit of God maketh the reading, but especially the preaching of 
                    the word, an effectual means of enlightening, convincing and humbling 
                    sinners . . . &quot;<a href="#11">[<b>11</b>]</a> <br />
                    <br />
                    Their answer to question 158 indicates that this work of preaching must 
                    be reserved only to the Ministers of the Word: &quot;The Word of God is to 
                    be preached only by such as are sufficiently gifted, and also duly approved 
                    and called to that office.&quot;<a href="#12">[<b>12</b>] <br />
                      </a><br />
                    The Westminster Assembly continues the emphasis that we have seen in earlier 
                    Reformed confessions, that not only is the Minister of the Word the only 
                    one who may preach the Word, but he is also the only one who may administer 
                    the sacraments. This is because of the Reformation emphasis that the sacraments 
                    are a visible form of preaching. The same message preached from the pulpit 
                    is set forth in the sacraments. If the sacraments are separated from the 
                    preaching, then they become mere meaningless rituals and soon become perverted 
                    into objects of Romish superstition. The same covenant of grace which 
                    is taught in the Word is symbolized and sealed in the sacraments. <br />
                    <br />
                    Larger Catechism answer 176 says of the Sacraments: &quot;. . . both are seals 
                    of the same covenant, are to be dispensed by ministers of the gospel, 
                    and by none other. ..&quot;[13] The <i>Westminster Confession of Faith</i>, 
                    chapter 27, &quot;Of the Sacraments,&quot; says in article IV: &quot;There be only two 
                    sacraments ordained by Christ our Lord in the gospel, that is to say, 
                    Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord; neither of which may be dispensed 
                    by any but by a minister of the word, lawfully ordained.&quot;[14] <br />
                    <br />
                    The Westminster Assembly also restricts reading the Scripture in public. 
                    Larger Catechism, answer 156, says, &quot;Although all are not to be permitted 
                    to read the word publickly to the congregation, yet all sorts of people 
                    are bound to read it apart by themselves ...&quot;15 This is further clarified 
                    by a statement in their <i>Directory for the Publick Worship of God</i>: 
                    &quot;Reading of the word in the congregation, being part of the publick worship 
                    of God, (wherein we acknowledge our dependence upon him, and subjection 
                    to him,) and one mean sanctified by him for the edifying of his people, 
                    is to be performed by the pastors and teachers. Howbeit, such as intend 
                    the ministry, may occasionally both read the word, and exercise their 
                    gift in preaching in the congregation, if allowed by the presbytery thereunto.&quot;16 
                    One notes that both the reading and the preaching of the Word is reserved 
                    exclusively for Ministers or for those intending the Ministry and already 
                    gifted in preaching, and given permission by the Presbytery, who would 
                    correspond to our licentiates. <br />
                    <br />
                    If the exception is made that an unordained ministerial candidate may 
                    preach, may he not also administer the sacraments? Their language on who 
                    may administer sacraments seems more restrictive than the language used 
                    on preaching. While an unordained ministerial candidate is clearly excluded 
                    from administering the sacraments, especially since the Westminster Confession 
                    even specifically says &quot;lawfully ordained,&quot; he could, as a ministerial 
                    candidate approved for preaching by the presbytery, fit in the language 
                    of Larger Catechism, answer 158, &quot;sufficiently gifted, and also duly approved 
                    and called to that office.&quot; It would appear that the Westminster divines, 
                    in writing the Larger Catechism, framed their answer on who may preach 
                    in such a way as to allow for the possibility of preaching by not-yet-ordained 
                    candidates who are gifted and called and approved, but also deliberately 
                    wrote on who may administer the sacraments so as to exclude them. <br />
                    <br />
                    Why should this be? Are the Sacraments so much more holy than preaching 
                    that the not-yet-ordained may perform the latter but not the former? The 
                    Westminster Assembly would certainly reject such a Romish position! The 
                    reason for the distinction is most likely that the administration of the 
                    sacraments requires an exercise of judgment beyond that which is involved 
                    in preaching. We may preach to all indiscriminately, but only certain 
                    persons are qualified to receive baptism and the Lord's Supper. Discipline 
                    is to be exercised in the church regarding these sacraments, and disciplinary 
                    judgments on sacramental occasions often fall upon the administrator of 
                    the sacrament. In the century leading up to the writing of the Westminster 
                    Standards, conflicts over the sacraments were common, and courage in the 
                    face of opposition was required. A not-yet-ordained ministerial candidate 
                    may have the gifts and calling to preach, but may not yet have the wisdom 
                    and the courage to make the disciplinary judgments necessary in administering 
                    the sacraments. Moreover, in administering the sacraments, a man is exercising 
                    discipline on behalf of the whole church, and should not exercise this 
                    authority until it has been given him by ordination. <br />
                    <br />
                    The Directory reiterates the teaching that the preaching of the Word has 
                    particular significance for salvation and that it is the exclusive prerogative 
                    of the Ministry by saying, &quot;Preaching of the Word, being the power of 
                    God unto salvation, and one of the greatest and most excellent works belonging 
                    to the ministry of the gospel, should be so performed, that the workman 
                    need not be ashamed, but may save himself, and those that hear him.&quot;<a href="#17">[<b>17</b>] </a><br />
                    <br />
                    We have already seen that the Larger Catechism, in its reference to preaching, 
                    refers to &quot;that office.&quot; We might well inquire as to the extent to which 
                    preaching is a distinctive office in the conception of the Westminster 
                    Assembly. Does this mean that it is utterly separate from other offices, 
                    such as the office of Elder? <i>The Form of Presbyterial Church-Goverment</i> by the Westminster Assembly gives us further insight into their understanding 
                    of church offices. <br />
                    <br />
                    They say, &quot;The officers which Christ hath appointed for the edification 
                    of his church, and the perfecting of the saints, are, some extraordinary, 
                    as apostles, evangelists, and prophets, which are ceased. Others ordinary 
                    and perpetual, as pastors, teachers, and other church-governors, and deacons.&quot;<a href="#18">[<b>18</b>]</a> <br />
                    <br />
                    It would appear from the above that there are many offices in the church. 
                    Minister of the Word is not named as a specific office here. The office 
                    of Pastor is mentioned, and it is obvious from their description that 
                    the Pastor is a Minister of the Word. However, they hold to a separate 
                    office of Teacher or Doctor, and he is also a Minister of the Word. <i>The 
                      Form of Church-Government</i> says, &quot;The scripture doth hold out the name 
                    and title of teacher, as well as of the pastor. Who is also a minister 
                    of the word, as well as the pastor, and hath power of administration of 
                    the Sacraments.<a href="#19">[<b>19</b>]</a> So we see that the office 
                    of Minister of the Word is divided into the two sub-offices of Pastor 
                    and Teacher. <br />
                    <br />
                    The Directory recognizes that the Pastor also holds the office of Elder. 
                    It says, &quot;The office of the elder (that is, the pastor) is to pray for 
                    the sick, even in private, to which a blessing is especially promised; 
                    much more therefore ought he to perform this in the publick execution 
                    of his office, as a part thereof.&quot;<a href="#20">[<b>20</b>]</a> <br />
                    <br />
                    It might appear from above that the Westminster Divines believed that 
                    the office of Pastor and Elder were exactly the same office, but we see 
                    that this is not the case when we read the following in The Form of Church-Government: </p>

                          in the church, hath furnished some in his church beside the ministers 
                          of the word, with gifts for government, and with commission to 
                          execute the same when called thereunto, who are to join with the 
                          minister in the government of the church. Which officers reformed

                  </table>
                  <p align="left">We see from the above that every Pastor, by virtue of being 
                    pastor, is an Elder. We also see that there are Elders in the church &quot;beside 
                    the ministers of the word&quot; which have gifts for government but, since 
                    they are not Ministers of the Word, therefore, may not preach. <i>The 
                      Form of Church-Government</i> does not indicate whether Teachers are also 
                    Elders. Teachers are connected with schools rather than with congregations, 
                    so they have no flock to govern. It is very likely the view of the Westminster 
                    Assembly that the office of Minister of the Word is divided into the offices 
                    of Pastor and Teacher and that all Pastors are Elders but Teachers are 
                    not necessarily Elders. The office of Elder is further divided into those 
                    Elders who are also Pastors and those Elders who are not Pastors. <i><br />
                      <br />
                      The Form of Church-Government</i> says regarding Deacons: &quot;The scripture 
                    doth hold out deacons as distinct officers in the church.&quot;<a href="#22">[<b>22</b>]</a> The use of the word &quot;distinct&quot; of Deacons may indicate that the Westminster 
                    Assembly recognizes that there is no sharp distinction between Ministers 
                    and Elders, but the kind of overlapping that we have mentioned above. <i><br />
                      <br />
                      The Form of Church Government</i> describes officers of a particular congregation 
                    in this way: &quot;For officers in a single congregation, there ought to be 
                    at the least, both to labour in the word and doctrine, and to rule. It 
                    is also requisite that there should be others to join in the government. 
                    And likewise it is requisite that there be others to take special care 
                    for the relief of the poor.&quot;<a href="#23">[<b>23</b>]</a> We then see 
                    that the officers of a particular church are Ministers, other Elders, 
                    and Deacons. <i><br />
                      <br />
                      The Form of Church-Government </i>does not give any specific information 
                    on the ordination of Deacons and of Elders, other than of Ministers of 
                    the Word. It does say that in the congregation, &quot;Some must be set apart 
                    to bear office.&quot;<a href="#24">[<b>24</b>]</a> However, this setting apart 
                    to bear office is not called ordination, except in the case of Ministers. 
                    Ordination seems to be specifically for the setting apart of Ministers. 
                    We read, &quot;Under the head of 'Ordination of Ministers' is to be considered, 
                    either the doctrine of ordination, or the power of it.&quot;<a href="#25">[<b>25</b>]</a> The doctrine of ordination is thus treated exclusively under the subject 
                    of the ordination of Ministers. <br />

                    There are long sections on ordination in The Form of Church-Government, 
                    and they all pertain exclusively to the ordination of Ministers. <br />
                    <br />
                    We conclude that, in the view of the Westminster Assembly, there was a 
                    special class or order of men called Ministers of the Word who are specially 
                    called by God, and they alone are entitled to preach, to administer the 
                    sacraments, and to read the Scriptures publicly, with the exception that 
                    candidates for the Ministry of the Word may be permitted or licensed by 
                    Presbytery to read and preach on a trial basis. <br />
                    <br />
                    The Ministry of the Word is a distinct office in the sense that only for 
                    the Ministry of the Word is one actually ordained, although other officers 
                    are set apart. It is not a distinct office in the sense that there are 
                    two offices, Pastor and Teacher, within the office of Minister of the 
                    Word. It is also not a distinct office in the sense that some Ministers, 
                    those who are Pastors, are also Elders; and some Elders, but not all Elders, 
                    are Ministers of the Word. There is thus not the same distinctiveness 
                    to the Ministry as an office as there is to the Diaconate as an office, 
                    but while there is certain overlapping among Ministers, Pastors, Teachers, 
                    and Elders, there is at the same time a distinct order of Ministers of 
                  the Word that receives an exclusive ordination. </p>
                  <p align="center"> MINISTERS OF THE WORD ACCORDING TO ROBERT L. DABNEY<br />
                  </p>
                  <p align="left"> We have seen the universal conviction of the early Reformed 
                    confessions and the Westminster Divines that there is a special order 
                    of men called by God as Ministers of the Word, and to them alone belongs 
                    the prerogative of preaching in the church. This conviction continued 
                    in the Reformed churches well into the last century and has remained wherever 
                    churches remained true to their Reformed heritage. This conviction was 
                    strongly present in the Presbyterian Church in the United States when 
                    that denomination, commonly known as the Southern Presbyterian Church, 
                    was faithful to the Scriptures and the Reformed faith. Robert L. Dabney, 
                    who is best known for his work as Professor of Theology at Union Theological 
                    Seminary of Richmond, Virginia, from 1869 to 1883, is representative of 
                    the best of Southern Presbyterian thought. We see the Reformed conviction 
                    on the Ministry of the Word clearly stated in his writings. <br />
                    <br />
  &quot;The church has always held that none should preach the gospel but those 
                    who are called of God,&quot;<a href="#26">[<b>26</b>]</a> is the statement 
                    with which Dabney opens his article, &quot;What is a Call to the Ministry?&quot; 
                    This categorical statement indicates not only Dabney's convictions but 
                    his understanding of the conviction of the whole of the Reformed Church. <br />
                    <br />
                    Further on in the same paper, he says, &quot;A call to preach is not complete 
                    until the Holy-Spirit has uttered it, not only in the Christian judgment 
                    of the candidate himself, but in that of his brethren also.&quot;<a href="#27">[<b>27</b>]</a> So the call, which is universally recognized as necessary for one to preach, 
                    is a call that must culminate in public recognition and ordination by 
                    the church. <br />
                    <br />
                    Dabney recognizes that lay preaching is inimical to Presbyterianism. He 
                    says, &quot;Let all Presbyterians, then, bear in mind, as one 'fixed fact,' 
                    that the recognition of laypreaching means broad-churchism.&quot;<a href="#28">[<b>28</b>]</a> <br />
                    <br />
                    But what of laymen who seem gifted and called to preach? There were two 
                    prominent lay evangelists at the time that Dabney was writing. One was 
                    D.L. Moody, a man not of Reformed convictions, and the other was Brownlow 
                    North, a Scotsman of definitely Reformed convictions.<a href="#29">[<b>29</b>] </a>Dabney writes: &quot;If, for instance, such laymen as the late Mr. Brownlow 
                    North and Mr. Moody have the qualifications and the seal of the divine 
                    blessing which their friends claim for them, this is, to our mind, a demonstration 
                    that God calls them into the regular ministry, and they should seek a 
                    regular ordination like other ministers, each in that branch of the church 
                    which has his conscientious preference.&quot;<a href="#30">[<b>30</b>] </a><br />
                    <br />
                    What is Dabney's view of the relationship between the Ministry of the 
                    Word and the office of Elder or Presbyter? This is clearly answered in 
                    an article, &quot;Theories of the Eldership,&quot; which originally appeared in 
                    the &quot;North Carolina Presbyterian,&quot; September, 1860. His position is stated 
                    thus: &quot;There is one class of presbyters embracing two orders, the preaching 
                    elder and the ruling elder. &quot;<a href="#31">[<b>31</b>]</a><br />
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">This indicates that Dabney held to a two-office view of 
                    the Church; that is, the only offices are Elder and Deacon. Within the 
                    one office of Elder, however, there are two separate orders; and the office 
                    of the Teaching Elder, or the Minister of the Word, is a separate order 
                    within the office of Elder or Presbyter, and that only those who are Ministers 
                    of the Word are permitted to preach. <br />
                    <br />
                    Dabney defends his distinction between the two orders in the one office 
                    as follows: </p>

                      <td><blockquote>Again, it is objected, that the Scriptures indicate no 
                        such distinction of work and title as we make between the preaching 
                        presbyter and the ruling presbyter; that as their qualifications 
                        are required to be the same, so no difference seems to be held forth 
                        in the work assigned them. This we positively deny. In Rom. 12:8, 
                        and 1 Cor. 12:28, we found the &quot;governing&quot; mentioned as a gift, 
                        a charism, bestowed on others than those who had the gifts of preaching. 
                        In. 1 Tim. 5:17, a clear distinction is implied between those who 
                        rule well, and those who also 'labor in word and doctrine.' And 
                        in Revelation, the closing book of the canon, where we would naturally 
                        expect to see the apostolic institutions in their matured form, 
                        we hear each church representatively addressed by its 'angel.' After 
                        all the thorny discussions as to the interpretation of this term, 
                        there is none so natural and tenable as that which makes the angel, 
                        in imitation of the well-known order and use of titles in the synagogue, 
                        the preaching presbyter, who presided over his brethren the presbyters, 
                        and was the public mouth-piece, or messenger, of the church to God, 
                        and of God to the church. So that we do assert, the distinction 
                        between the titles and tasks of the preaching and ruling presbyters, 
                        while yet both are proper presbyters, is as plain in the New Testament 
                        as could be expected.<a href="#32">[<b>32</b>]</a></blockquote></td>
                    </tr>
                  </table>
                  <p align="left"> Dabney's view that the two orders compose one office leads 
                    him to believe that both should have what he calls a &quot;presbyterial ordination.&quot; 
                    This would distinguish him from the Westminster Assembly which would appear 
                    to recognize no ordination for those set apart as Ruling Elders. However, 
                    Dabney teaches a different Presbyterial ordination for the Minister of 
                    the Word. He says, &quot;The ruling elder should be ordained in the parochial 
                    presbytery, the session.... while the preacher is ordained in the district 
                    presbytery. &quot;<a href="#33">[<b>33</b>]</a> <br />
                    <br />
                    Dabney also argues vigorously for special theological training for the 
                    Minister of the Word. He recognizes that special academic training was 
                    not required in the early church, but points out that in the early church 
                    the Elders were able to read the New Testament in the original language. 
                    He says, &quot;Then the language of the New Testament was their living vernacular; 
                    now it is a dead and a difficult language, only partially understood by 
                    the learned. . . . All this modern training does not put the preacher 
                    back where every educated Christian stood in apostolic days, and repair 
                    the thefts of biblical knowledge made by time and change.&quot;<a href="#34">[<b>34</b>]</a> Of special interest is his article, &quot;A Thoroughly Educated Ministry,&quot;

                    The conviction that there is a special order of Elders uniquely called 
                    of God to be Ministers of the Word, to be specially trained and ordained 
                    by the church, and to whom alone belongs the prerogative of preaching, 
                    is a conviction that runs right from the early stages of the Reformation 
                  to the Southern Presbyterian Church in the last ' century. </p>
                  <p align="center"> MINISTERS OF THE WORD IN SCRIPTURE<br />
                  </p>
                  <p align="left"> It has been axiomatic to Reformed Christians for centuries 
                    that there is in the church an order of men especially called and gifted 
                    of God for preaching the gospel who are to be recognized and ordained 
                    by the church for this prerogative. At least until the time of Dabney, 
                    one could confidently assert, as we have seen that Dabney did, &quot;The church 
                    has always held that none should preach the gospel but those who are called 
                    of God.&quot; <br />
                    <br />
                    Evidence of the truth of the Reformed doctrine of preaching seemed through 
                    the centuries to be running right through the Bible. It was incontestable. <br />
                    <br />
                    There are in the Scriptures specific statements about the power of the 
                    preached Word through the Lord's appointed Ministers. Among such statements 
                    are the following: &quot;</p>

                        - Other accounts of persons being called to preaching or to the 
                        prophetic office. Prophets in biblical times exercised their gifts 
                        in a unique way by giving new revelation, but it has often been 
                        understood in Reformed churches that preaching in the present day 
                        is a form of prophesying, although in the lesser sense of interpreting 
                        in the power of the Spirit that which has already been given. If 
                        Paul and the apostles, who gave new revelation, can be considered 
                        examples of persons called to preach, so also may Old Testaments 
                        prophets. <br />

                        that some have gifts for preaching, but many others have quite different 
                        gifts. Particular interest is focused on Romans 12:4-8, 1 Corinthians 
                        12:4-11 and 27:31, and Ephesians 4:11-12. <br />

                        instructions about preaching which are not given in epistles to 
                        believers generally. Timothy's particular gift of preaching is mentioned 
                        in connection with his ordination &quot;with the laying on of the hands 
                        of the presbytery&quot; in 1 Timothy 4:14. <br />
                        - Specific passages in which the Apostle Paul speaks of having a 
                        special ministry. One verse, often cited in Reformed confessions, 
                        is 1 Corinthians 4:1, &quot;Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers 
                        of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.&quot; </blockquote></td>

                    seen in the life and the practice of the Presbyterian Church in America 
                    and forms part of the background for the formation of the Ad-Interim Committee 
                    on the Number of Offices in the Church. <br />
                    <br />
                    The reason for the present writer's difficulty is that the first few years 
                    of my Christian experience, after being born again, were spent in the 
                    sect of the Plymouth Brethren, which denies that there is a special order 
                    in the church of men called and ordained to preach the Word, and teaches 
                    that all believers are Ministers of the Word. For a number of years I 
                    held to their doctrine. From 1 Timothy 5:17, the Lord convinced me that 
                    there are those in the church who give themselves full-time to the Ministry 
                    of the Word and received honorarium, as well as honor, for their work. 
                    And through such an understanding, the Lord was able to call me into the 
                    Ministry of the Word. However, for quite a number of years, even after 
                    being ordained in the Ministry and serving as a pastor, I experienced 
                    confusion in this area. I was not sufficiently aware that I had received 
                    a distinctive calling and gift, but suspected instead that I was simply 
                    led to practice, on a full-time and paid basis, gifts which all Christians 
                    have and which all Christians ought to exercise at least part-time. <br />
                    <br />
                    The teaching of the Plymouth Brethren has leavened the whole of modern 
                    evangelicalism, especially in this country. Pentecostalism has exercised 
                    a similar confusion, although Pentecostalism recognizes a diversity of 
                    gifts and callings and does not teach, in quite the same manner as the 
                    Plymouth Brethren, that all believers are gifted and called to be Ministers 
                    of the Word. The struggle that I have gone through personally is thus 
                    a microcosm of the struggle that modem evangelicalism is going through. 
                    The doubts and the difficulties that I had are the doubts and the difficulties 
                    that modem evangelicalism still has. It is still significant, therefore, 
                    to give particular attention to this problem in this paper, and especially 
                    in the manner in which it has worked out in my own mind and experience. <br />
                    <br />
                    At the heart of the problem is the distinctive Plymouth Brethren interpretation 
                    of Ephesians 4:11-12, which reads as follows in the King James version: </p>

                        for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: </blockquote></td>
                    </tr>
                  </table>
                  <p align="left">The Plymouth Brethren insist that the King James version 
                    errs in placing a comma after the word 'saints' in verse 12. The perfecting 
                    of the saints and the work of the ministry are not two separate functions 
                    of apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers. Rather, these 
                    gifted men have the one function of perfecting the saints, who in turn 
                    do the work of the ministry. They perfect the saints &quot;unto&quot; the work of 
                    the ministry, which is, in turn, &quot;unto&quot; the edifying of the body. The 
                    way that the church is to be built up is that apostles, prophets, evangelists, 
                    pastors and teachers perfect the saints to minister to one another, and 
                    in this way the whole body is built up. Up to this point, the Plymouth 
                    Brethren argument is a sound one. It has been accepted by evangelicalism 
                    generally, and has had the happy consequence that believers do understand 
                    that they are to minister to one another and, as such, do participate 
                    in various forms of ministry. <br />
                    <br />
                    However, the Plymouth Brethren form of this argument goes further, and 
                    here it departs from the truth and becomes dangerous. They reason that 
                    since all the saints are being equipped for the work of the ministry, 
                    then all the saints are Ministers, every believer is a Minister of the 
                    Word. It is wrong for an individual to refer to himself as a &quot;Minister,&quot; 
                    as if he had some distinctive office or right to preach. As a believer, 
                    he is a Minister, but so is every believer, and he has no right to arrogate 
                    to himself prerogatives that belong to every believer. It would be acceptable 
                    for an individual to refer to himself as &quot;evangelist&quot; or &quot;pastor&quot; or &quot;teacher,&quot; 
                    but never as &quot;Minister.&quot; And even though he may have one of the gifts 
                    mentioned in verse 11, he should realize that that does not make him in 
                    any special sense a Minister of the Word more that other believers. Rather 
                    he is to recognize that the Ministry of the Word belongs to all believers, 
                    and his task is to equip others to minister the Word. <br />
                    <br />
                    The Plymouth Brethren goes further in that it denies that the apostles, 
                    prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers in verse 11 are in any sense 
                    to be office bearers in the church. They are simply unobtrusive members 
                    of the body exercising unique gifts for the benefit of the rest. However, 
                    that particular argument is more artificial, is not generally adhered 
                    to by modern evangelicals, and is not the problem in modern evangelicalism 
                    that is the position of the previous paragraph. <br />
                    <br />
                    What shall we say to this? It should be noted first of all that Ephesians 
                    4:12 indicates that the saints are engaged in the work of the ministry, 
                    but it does not say specifically the Ministry of the Word. There are various 
                    ministries. The word used here is <i>diakonia</i> and may refer to any 
                    type of service. It is the word which is used for the office of a Deacon 
                    who serves, but his service is aid and help of a more material sort. The 
                    word has the more specific meaning of &quot;the service necessary for preparation 
                    of a meal,&quot;<a href="#36">[<b>36</b>]</a> and also has the meaning of &quot;aid, 
                    support, distribution, especially of alms and charitable giving.&quot;<a href="#36">[<b>36</b>] </a><br />
                    <br />
                    It has been argued that Philip was a Deacon and Philip preached, so all 
                    Deacons, and really all those who are servants of Christ, should preach. 
                    However, he is also called &quot;Philip the evangelist&quot; (Acts 21:8), indicating 
                    that he was distinctly called and ordained into the office of Evangelist, 
                    which is an office of a Minister of the Word and one of the offices specifically 
                    named in Ephesians 4:11.<a href="#37">[<b>37</b>]</a> <br />
                    <br />
                    There is not a shred of evidence that the ministry to be exercised by 
                    the saints in Ephesians 4:12 is the Ministry of the Word. Since the New 
                    Testament passages on gifts, particularly Roman 12 and 1 Corinthians 12, 
                    indicate that there are a variety of gifts given to different individuals, 
                    it would follow that the ministry of the saints would be the ministry 
                    of all the various gifts given for us to serve one another and edify the 
                    church. <br />
                    <br />
                    It should also be noted that the gifts named in Ephesians 4:11 are all 
                    preaching and teaching gifts. The various functions of Ministers of the 
                    Word are spelled out in verse 11, and therefore separated from the common 
                    ministries of the saints in verse 12. It would then follow that the ministry 
                    of verse 12 includes all ministries that can be performed by the saints, 
                    with the exception of the specific gifts of Ministry of the Word, which 
                    have already been enumerated. God gives Ministers of the Word to equip 
                    all other believers to engage in all of the other ministries and gifts 
                    to complete the upbuilding of the church. <br />
                    <br />
                    The word for ministry and service may refer to all ministries and service 
                    generally or may refer to specific ministries, with the context defining 
                    the specific ministry intended. In some cases, the word refers specifically 
                    to the ministry of the. Deacon. Romans 13:4 indicates that the civil magistrate 
                    is &quot;the minister of God,&quot; not that he is a Minister of the Word, but a 
                    minister of the sword. <br />
                    <br />
                    In addition to the word <i>diakonia</i>, which we have mentioned, there 
                    is also the: word <i>huperetis</i>. It means &quot;servant, helper, assistant 
                    ... a synagogue attendant .. , a king's retinue ... the apostles as servants 
                    of Christ.&quot;<a href="#38">[<b>38</b>]</a> It is the word used when Paul 
                    says, &quot;Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, the 
                    stewards of the mysteries of God&quot; (1 Cor. 4:1). <br />
                    <br />
                    In Luke 1:2, it is used specifically of &quot;<i>ministers</i> of the word.&quot; 
                    In Luke 4:20, when Jesus preached at the synagogue, the word is used when 
                    it says, &quot;And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the <i>minister</i>, 
                    and sat down.&quot; It is used in Acts 13:5, which says that John was &quot;their <i>minister</i>,&quot; speaking of the synagogues of the Jews at Salamis. So 
                    we see that the apostles use the word <i>huperetis</i> for their function 
                    as Ministers of the Word based on the use of that word of the <i>Minister</i> in the synagogue. <i>Huperetis</i> was also used by the Lord Jesus Christ 
                    when he called Paul and said, &quot;I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, 
                    to make thee a <i>minister</i> and a witness ... delivering thee from 
                    the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom I now send thee, to open 
                    their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power 
                    of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance 
                    among them that are sanctified by faith that is in me&quot; (Acts 26:16-18). <br />
                    <br />
                    There are other words used in the New Testament of the Ministry of the 
                    Word. Two different ones are used by Paul in Romans 15:16: &quot;That I should 
                    be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel 
                    of God.&quot; The word that he uses for &quot;minister&quot; is <i>leitourgos</i>, and 
                    the word which he uses for &quot;ministering&quot; is <i>hierourgeo</i>. Both of 
                    these words refer to the work of the Old Testament priests, and indicate 
                    that the Ministry of the gospel is the New Testament equivalent of the 
                    work of the specially-called and ordained priests of the Old Testament. <br />
                    <br />
                    This connection between the ordained priesthood and the gospel ministry 
                    is further exemplified in 1 Corinthians 9:13,14: &quot;Do ye not know that 
                    they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? 
                    and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar? Even so 
                    hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of 
                    the gospel.&quot; <br />
                    <br />
                    These explicit connections between the Gospel Ministry and the Old Testament 
                    priesthood cause us to go back and take yet another look at Ephesians 
                    4:11-12. The context of that passage is a quotation from Psalm 68:18, 
                    which is quoted in Ephesians 4:8 and expounded in 4:9-10. Psalms 68:18 
                    says, &quot;Thou has ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou 
                    hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the Lord 
                    God might dwell among them.&quot; Ephesians 4:8-10 refers this to Christ's 
                    ascension to receive gifts, which he has given to men. These gifts are 
                    those enumerated in verse 11; in other words, apostles, prophets, evangelists, 
                    pastors and teachers. It is not simply that he gives some men the gifts 
                    to function as apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers. 
                    The thought is more that the men who are apostles, prophets, evangelists, 
                    pastors are given to the church to minister the Word and to equip the 
                    saints for other forms of ministry. Different men get different gifted 
                    Ministers of the Word to work among them. Some need evangelists, and to 
                    them evangelists are given. Some need pastors and teachers, and to them 
                    pastors and teachers are given.<br />
                    <br />
                    What light is shed on Ephesians 4:8-12 by studying the meaning of Psalm 
                    68:18? If one studies Psalm 68:18 in the light of such scriptures as Isaiah 
                    66:20-21 and Numbers 8:6-19, one may conclude that the gifts referred 
                    to in Psalm 68:18 are the Levitical priests. The Levites were taken from 
                    among the tribes of Israel by the Lord, and those who were taken as captives 
                    by the Lord were given back to Israel to minister to them as priests. 
                    In the same way, God shall bring Israelites &quot;out of all nations&quot; (Isa. 
                    66:20) and give them back &quot;for priests and for Levites&quot; (Isa. 66:21). 
                    Psalm 68:18 speaks of the ascended Christ taking men as captives and then 
                    giving them back as &quot;gifts for men.&quot; These gifts, according to Ephesians 
                    4:11-12 are the apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers 
                    that Christ gives to His church.<a href="#39">[<b>39</b>]</a> <br />
                    <br />
                    We have seen that the word <i>huperetis </i>has been borrowed from the 
                    Old Testament synagogue, and the words <i>leitourgos</i> and <i>hierourgeo </i>have been borrowed from the Old Testament priesthood, to refer to 
                    the Ministers of the New Testament gospel, whom the ascended Christ has 
                    given as gifts to His church, even as the Levites were given in the Old 
                    Testament. <br />
                    <br />
                    The most common words for &quot;minister&quot; and &quot;ministry&quot; in the New Testament 
                    were the words <i>diakonis</i> and <i>diakonia</i>, the very general words 
                    for servant and service which can be used of other kinds of service, including, 
                    as we have seen, the civil magistrate as &quot;a minister of God,&quot; but also 
                    used in a very specific sense for the Minister and Ministry of the Word. 
                    Here are some examples of these words used in this specialized sense: </p>

                        &quot;But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry

                        God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry&quot; (Acts 21:19). <br />
                        &quot;Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye 
                        believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?&quot; (1 Cor. 3:5). <br />
                        &quot;Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament&quot; (2 Cor. 
                        3:6). <br />
                        &quot;Therefore, seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, 
                        we faint not&quot; (2 Cor. 4:1). &quot;God ... Hath given to us the ministry 
                        to reconciliation&quot; (2 Cor. 5:18). <br />
                        &quot;Giving no offense in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed: 
                        But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God&quot; (2 
                        Cor. 6:3, 4). <br />
                        &quot;Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace 
                        of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power&quot; (Eph. 
                        3:7). <br />
                        &quot; .. Epaphras our dear fellow servant, who is for you a faithful 
                        minister of Christ&quot; (Col. 1:7). <br />
                        &quot;... the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to 
                        every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister; 
                        . , Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation 
                        of God . which is given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God&quot; 
                        (Col. 1:23-25). &quot;Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and 
                        our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ&quot; (1 Thess. 3:2). <br />
                        &quot;And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that 
                        he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry&quot; (1 Tim. 1:12). <br />
                        &quot;If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt 
                        be a good minister of Jesus Christ&quot; (1 Tim. 4:6). <br />
                        &quot;But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of 
                        an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry&quot; (2 Tim. 4:5). <br />
                        &quot;Take Mark and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for 
                        the ministry&quot; (2 Tim. 4:11). </blockquote></td>

                  <p align="left">It is evident from these studies that the Bible teaches 
                    clearly that there is a distinct order of men in the New Testament church 
                    who are Ministers of the Word. Just as the Lord chose the Levites out 
                    of all the tribes of Israel and gave them back to Israel as priests, so 
                    the ascended Christ has taken certain men out of his church and given 
                    them back to the church as His gifts to the church, Ministers of the Word. 
                    They are as distinct an order in the church as was the Old Testament priesthood 
                    and have as much right to make their living off of their Ministry as did 
                    the Old Testament priests. Their office and work is referred to in the 
                    New Testament with certain words that have been borrowed from the Old 
                    Testament priesthood and from the Minister in the synagogue. In addition, 
                    the word which means &quot;servant&quot; or &quot;service&quot; in the most general sense 
                    is frequently used in the New Testament in the very specialized sense 
                    of referring to these Ministers and their Ministry of the Word. Every 
                    believer has certain gifts from the Holy Spirit, and different individuals 
                    have different gifts, but these individuals are given particular gifts 
                    for the Ministry of the Word. They are called to the Ministry of the Word 
                    by Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit, even as the original disciples and 
                    the Apostle Paul were called. Their call is to be recognized by the church, 
                    which should set them apart and ordain them for the Ministry of the Word 
                    by the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery. Since the Ministry of 
                    the Word is closely related to the government of the church, all those 
                    who are Ministers of the Word are also Elders of the church. However, 
                    there are also Elders in the church that are not Ministers of the Word 
                    and do not preach. Ministers of the Word are thus a special order within 
                    the general class of Elders. All Ministers of the Word do not have exactly 
                    the same ministry. Christ gives some as pastors to settled churches. He 
                    gives some as evangelists to have an itinerant ministry and to go to places 
                    where there is no settled church. He gives some as teachers, whose ministry 
                    might be the same as pastors or might be yet a different kind of ministry, 
                    complementing the pastors. Ministers of the Word equip lay Christians 
                    to minister to one another in various other ways and with various gifts 
                    so that the whole church may be built up. Lay Christians may teach one 
                    another in an informal fashion and may exhort one another, but the work 
                    of preaching is reserved exclusively by God for those whom He has called 
                    and appointed as Ministers of the Word.</p>
                  <p align="center">CONCLUSIONS</p>
                  <p align="left">I heartily agree with Dabney when he says, as cited above: 
                    &quot;There is one <i>class </i>of presbyters embracing two <i>orders</i>, 
                    the preaching elder and the ruling elder.&quot; This statement expresses concisely 
                    the biblical teaching on the subject. It is true to our Reformed heritage, 
                    while at the same time cutting through the confusion that has existed 
                    with many different confessions and writers giving different lists of 
                    the offices in the church, and even separate offices within the Ministry. 
                    Dabney's understanding of one class or one office of Elder with two orders 
                    also helps us with several practical problems presently before the Presbyterian 
                    Church in America. <br />
                    <br />
                    One of these problems is the need to raise our comprehension of the order 
                    of Ruling Elder. In many of our churches Ruling Elders have been elected 
                    and ordained when neither those elected nor the congregations which have 
                    chosen them has a biblical understanding of what it means to be Elders. 
                    They are thought of as nothing more than members of a church board entitled 
                    to make policy decisions. Ruling Elders should recognize that they are 
                    of the same <i>class</i> of office bearers as Teaching Elders, with the 
                    pastoral responsibilities of shepherding, nurturing and disciplining the 
                    flock. Only as they understand these responsibilities will they seek, 
                    by God's grace, to fulfill them. We also need congregations which will 
                    adequately understand the office of Elder so that they will elect men 
                    who are divinely qualified to fulfill the functions. <br />
                    <br />
                    The second practical problem confronting our church is the need for people 
                    to understand the distinctiveness of the <i>order</i> of the Ministry 
                    of the Word. One can no longer confidently assert, as was confidently 
                    asserted by Dabney a century ago, and was cited above, &quot;The church has 
                    always held that none should preach the gospel but those who are called 
                    of God.&quot; Because of the influence of Plymouth Brethrenism and Pentecostalism, 
                    many in the church in our own day believe that every Christian is called 
                    to be a Minister of the Word. <br />
                    <br />
                    The devil delights in pendulum thinking. In a previous age, many Reformed 
                    Christians seemed to feel that they had no responsibility for the evangelization 
                    of their unconverted neighbors, except to invite them to come to church 
                    to hear a gospel sermon. It was the Minister alone who had the responsibility 
                    to evangelize the lost. Now it is properly recognized that every Christian 
                    is to be a witness. Many are evangelizing their neighbors through informal 
                    conversations and neighborhood Bible classes. Many are reaching their 
                    neighbors through para-church organizations with specialized ministries 
                    to reach special groups of persons, servicemen or university students, 
                    for example, and reach many who might not otherwise ever enter a church. 
                    Many have benefited from special training in particular methods and techniques 
                    of presenting the gospel. Much good has come from the active witnessing 
                    of Christian laymen. <br />
                    <br />
                    However, the pendulum appears to have swung too far in the other direction. 
                    Many feel that it is as good or even better to go to a home Bible study 
                    than to go to church on a Sunday evening, and maybe even on a Sunday morning, 
                    to hear a Minister of the Word preach the Word. There is a tendency to 
                    look upon what is called &quot;the institutional church&quot; as being little more 
                    than an outmoded relic of the past, and to believe that God will use para-church 
                    organizations of witnessing laymen as effectively, or more effectively, 
                    than he uses the church. Some are much more concerned to invite their 
                    friends to informal Bible studies or even formal meetings of their para-church 
                    organizations, than they are to invite their unsaved neighbors to come 
                    to church to hear the Minister of the Word proclaim the Word. Some who 
                    are effectively-witnessing laymen see no difference between themselves 
                    and the Minister, except that they support themselves in their own ministry 
                    with a secular occupation, while the Minister is involved in full-time 
                    ecclesiastical employment. <br />
                    <br />
                    Even as there is a tendency of Ruling Elders to think of themselves as 
                    simply members of the church Board of Directors, so there is the tendency 
                    to look upon the Minister as being little more that the church administrative 
                    secretary and their hired employee. This may be particularly the case 
                    when the Ruling Elder teaches a Men's Bible Class or has some other teaching 
                    ministry, perhaps in a para-church organization. He may not consider that 
                    there is any difference between the Minister of the Word and himself, 
                    except that he supports himself in a secular employment and the Minister 
                    does not. <br />
                    <br />
                    We need to assert anew that the preaching of the gospel is a God-called 
                    and God-anointed work, and to insist that none be permitted to preach 
                    except those whose gifts and calling have been recognized and who have 
                    been ordained by the church. We may also permit licentiates who, after 
                    the teaching of the Westminster Assembly, as cited above, are candidates 
                    for the ministry and have been given permission to preach by the Presbytery 
                    and have thus received, in effect, a trial ordination. This would agree 
                    with Paul's teaching to Timothy, &quot;Lay hands suddenly on no man&quot; (I Tim. 
                    5:22). Paul has said that a Bishop must be &quot;not a novice&quot; (I Tim. 3:6), 
                    and this would certainly apply to a Bishop who is a Minister of the Word. 
                    Of the Deacons, Paul has written, &quot;And let these also first be proved, 
                    and then let them use the office of a Deacon&quot; (I Tim. 3:10). The &quot;also&quot; 
                    would indicate that Elders must be proved as well as Deacons, and so a 
                    period of trial for a man whom God has possibly called as a Minister of 
                    the Word, and who is seeking a permanent ordination to that office, is 
                    very much in order. <br />
                    <br />
                    There are among us many Ruling Elders and others who feel gifted and called 
                    to preach. Many presently vacant pulpits would be without any Ministry 
                    if it were not for these lay preachers. But the past century has well 
                    proven the truth of Mr. Dabney's above-cited prophecy, &quot;Lay preaching 
                    means broad churchism.&quot; It also means much confused and faulty doctrinal 
                    teaching by untrained, undisciplined, and unlicensed speakers. Let us 
                    exhort lay preachers, as Dabney exhorted Moody and North, that they become 
                    licensed by their Presbyteries and begin work toward regular ordination 
                    in the church. <br />
                    <br />
                    The administration of the sacraments must be closely joined with the preaching 
                    of the Word. There should be no administration of the sacraments when 
                    there is not at the same time the preaching of the Word. We have noted 
                    that the Reformed standards give to the Ministers of the Word the exclusive 
                    prerogatives both of preaching and of administering the sacraments. We 
                    should adhere to this rule: none may preach but those who have been ordained 
                    or licensed, and none may administer the sacraments who are not ordained 
                    to preach. <br />
                    <br />
                    It is apparent that we may not permit any to preach except Ministers and 
                    approved ministerial candidates, unless we first revise the Westminster 
                    Standards. We may not permit Ruling Elders to preach, unless they are 
                    simultaneously candidates for the ministry, without revising the Westminster 
                    Standards, and we may not permit any unordained person, even a licentiate, 
                    to administer the sacraments, without revising the Westminster Standards. 
                    Indeed, such practices appear not only to depart from the Westminster 
                    Standards and the universal practice of the Reformed Churches, but from 
                    the Word of God itself. <br />
                    <br />
                    We must resist the pressures of the weak evangelicalism of our times and 
                    boldly assert the Reformed faith with all of its implications. We need 
                    to encourage the witnessing of every Christian, but steadfastly maintain 
                    that the public preaching of the Word of God has a distinctive efficacy, 
                    and emphasize that the preaching of the Word is something which can only 
                    truly be done by those who are called by God and licensed or ordained 
                    by His Church. </p>

                    very valuable discussion on the distinction between the preaching of the 
                    gospel by ordained Ministers and the witness of laymen, he says: </font></p>

                        <p><font size="2">This distinction is brought out in a most interesting 
                          way in Acts 8 in verses 4 and 5. There we are told in the first 
                          verse that a great persecution of the Church arose in Jerusalem, 
                          and that all the members of the Church were scattered abroad except 
                          the Apostles. Then we are told in verses 4 and 5, 'therefore they 
                          that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the Word. 
                          Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ 
                          unto them.' That is the King James Version translation, and in 
                          both cases you have the word 'preached'. But in the original the 
                          same word was not used in the two verses; and this is the vital 
                          distinction. What 'the people' who went everywhere did was, as 
                          someone has suggested it might be translated, 'to gossip' the 
                          Word, to talk about it in conversation. Philip on the other hand 
                          did something different: he was 'heralding' the Gospel. This is, 
                          strictly speaking, what is meant by preaching in the sense that 
                          I have been using it. It is not accidental that such a distinction 
                          should be drawn there in the actual text. That is the position 
                          then, that every Christian should be capable of doing what is 
                          indicated in the fourth verse, but that only some are called upon 
                          to do what is indicated in the fifth verse. In the New Testament 
                          this distinction is drawn very clearly; certain people only are 
                          set apart and called upon to deliver the message, as it were, 
                          on behalf of the Church in an official manner. That act is confined 
                          to the elders, and only to some of them - the teaching elders, 
                          the elder who has received the gift of teaching, the pastors and 
                          the teachers. It is clear that the preaching in the New Testament 
                          was confined to the Apostles and the prophets and the evangelists 
                          and these others. </font></p>
