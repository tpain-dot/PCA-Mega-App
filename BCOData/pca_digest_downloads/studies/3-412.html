                        B. Purity of the Church.  1 Cor. 5:4: &quot;In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, along with my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, [5] deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. [6] Your glorying is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? [7] Therefore purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, since you truly are unleavened.<br />
                        C. Reclamation of the wayward.  Mat. 18:15-20. Note contextual concern for &quot;one of the least of these&quot; in 18:10-14, and the transition then to 15, <em>eau da</em>, with the goal of winning (<em>ekerdesas</em>) the brother.<br />
                        D. If &quot;C&quot; were the <em>only</em> goal of discipline, then we would never discipline those who appeared to be &quot;lost causes.&quot; Yet the glory of God and the purity of the church are also at stake. In 1 Cor. 5, Paul urges the Corinthians to remove the offender, not only for his sake, but for <em>their</em> sake, warning that a little leaven would poison the entire church.<br />
                        E. It is thus <em>never</em> true that discipline will &quot;do no good.&quot; That a given individual may not immediately respond favorably does not mean that &quot;no good&quot; is done. Often there is no immediate, visible response to preaching, or to the administration of the Lord's Supper, or to prayer; this does not mean that preaching and the Lord's Supper and prayer &quot;do no good.&quot; It merely means that God the Holy Spirit <em>uses</em> his own ordinances <em>as </em>he wishes <em>when </em>he wishes. </blockquote></td>

Through the blessing of God, such instruction is the instrument by which the affections and thoughts of God's people are brought into conformity with his own affections and thoughts. <br />
                            2.Godly example and encouragement. Within the professing community, the godly example and patient encouragement of others also has a discipling or disciplining effect. <br />
                            3. Prayer. The patient, persisting prayer of other saints is a means by which God sanctifies and disciplines his people. <br />
                            4. Sacraments. Baptism and the Lord's Supper are means by which, positively, we learn about our duties and privileges as saints, and are increasingly disciplined in the Christian life and graces. <br />
                            5. Other?
                            There may be many other, specific ways in which the Christian is disciplined in the Christian life in a positive way.</p>

                            2. Corporate worship; the means of grace (frequent preaching and communion?). Weekly assembling for God's worship undoubtedly functions preveniently, to call us back to communion with God before we go astray. <br />
                            3. Visitation by shepherds. Pastoral visitation by pastor and elders undoubtedly prevents many sins from beginning or continuing. <br />
                            4. Prayer by shepherds. Surely the patient, persisting prayers of saints and officers is frequently blessed by God to prevent sin from manifesting itself. <br />

                          <p>1. Private stage &quot;go and point out the fault when the two of you are alone. This stage should not be quickly dispensed with, as though it were a mere formality. In the great wisdom of God (who knows our frame, that we are but dust), this is a very important stage, for at least two reasons. First, at this stage there is no public scandal. Disrepute has not yet come upon the Bride of Christ, because at this point, only two people are aware of the incident. For this reason, one should persevere at this stage patiently, for as long as there is any evidence that progress is being made. Second, people tend to be defensive about allegations against them. And, they tend to become more defensive the more public the allegations become. Therefore, it is much more likely that an individual will be humble, meek, or contrite, when dealt with tenderly and privately, than if dealt with publicly. <br />
                            2. Arbitration stage &quot;But if you are not listened to, take one or two others along with you.&quot; Sometimes, even after a patient, extended season of private discussion, two brothers do not settle the dispute, and others must be brought in to attempt to facilitate resolution. Much wisdom should be exercised at this stage, in selecting arbiters who will be manifestly impartial, patient, and discreet.<br />
                            3.
                            Ecclesiastical/formal stage &quot;If the member refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church.&quot; 1 Cor. 5:3-4 &quot;For though absent in body, I am present in spirit; and as if present I have already <em>pronounced judgment</em> in the name of the Lord Jesus on the man who has done such a thing.&quot; Regrettably, there will on some occasions be no resolution to a dispute even after the arbitration stage. On such regrettable moments, there is no alternative other than to bring the matter before the appropriate church-court for resolution. </p>

                            Sentimentalism.  Few people are capable of the kind of dispassionate judgment that discipline requires; they tend to sympathize with a party or against a party. </p>

There are clauses in it that are unique in Presbyterian history, thus rendering the opinions and actions of previous Presbyterian bodies somewhat moot in terms of the direction we might glean from them (e.g. the provision for a congregation withdrawing from the denomination unilaterally in <em><a href="../../../bco/fog/25/11.html">BCO </a></em><a href="../../../bco/fog/25/11.html">25-11</a>; the provision for a non-delegated General Assembly).<br />
                            2. Our <em>BCO</em> is a &quot;moving target,&quot; potentially changing every year, occasionally frustrating the efforts of those who conscientiously attempt to learn it. (Other, earlier Presbyterian bodies had no provision for piecemeal changes. When the Book was considered significantly deficient, a Revision Committee was erected; which worked for years on a wholescale revision, which was then debated as a whole. <br />

                            Our Book of Discipline is <em>conceptually</em> arranged, not <em>procedurally</em> arranged. Thus, it is sometimes difficult to determine what needs to be done first, second, third, etc. (N.B., this committee is working on developing a <a href="3-443.html">checklist of judicial procedures</a>, in an effort to ameliorate this effect).<br />
