<p>In addition to the &quot;<a href="../../documents/message.html">Message

  adopted the report of the Committee on Mission to the United States, which 

  contains similar declarations as to the mission and purpose of the Church. 

  Though some of this is repetitious to that of the &quot;Message to A ll 

  Churches&quot;, the very fact that the Assembly declared herself in this 

  way twice, indicates the great unity and commitment of that Assembly on 

  these issues.</p>

      <p><b>REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON MISSION TO THE UNITED STATES</b></p>

      <p>Introduction</p>

      <p>From Holy Scripture we steadfastly affirm that the salvation of souls, 

        the growth of Christ's church, even the coming of Christ's kingdom, of 

        momentous importance though they may be and actually are, are but means 

        to a still higher end, the highest of all ends - God's glorification. 

        (Romans 11:36)</p>

      <p>From Holy Scripture we unequivocally affirm the truth of our Lord's Great 

        Commission to proclaim the Gospel to every person, regardless of human 

        position, in our local area, in our nation, and to the uttermost parts 

        of the earth. We desire &quot;distinctly and deliberately to inscribe 

        on our church's banner as she now unfurls it to the world, in immediate 

        connection with the headship of our Lord. His last command: &quot;Go ye 

        into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature;&quot; regarding 

        this as the great end of her organization, and obedience to it as the 

        indispensable condition of her Lord's promised presence, and as one great 

        comprehensive object, a proper conception of whose vast magnitude and 

        grandeur is the only thing which, in connection with the love of Christ, 

        can ever sufficiently arouse her energies and develop her resources so 

        as to cause her to carry on, with the vigor and efficiency which true 

        fealty to her Lord demands, those other agencies necessary to her internal 

        growth and home prosperity.&quot; (Matthew 28:18-20, Mark 16:15-18, Luke 

        24:46-48, Acts 1:8).</p>

      <p>From Holy Scripture we unhesitatingly affirm that the theology of the 

        historic Reformed faith as set forth in the <i>Westminster Confession 

          of Faith</i> as originally adopted in 1789 together with the <i>Westminster 

            Larger and Shorter Catechisms</i> requires vigorous evangelism to the 

        end that God be glorified in the salvation of His elect. We are firmly 

        persuaded that the more thoroughly Reformed a church is the more evangelistic 

        it will be. Far from rendering evangelism superfluous, the Reformed doctrines 

        of the sovereignty of God, predestination, and election demand zealous 

        evangelism. All of God's elect must be saved. Not one of them may perish. 

        And the gospel is the means by which God bestows saving faith upon them. 

        An equally significant conclusion is that the Reformed doctrine of election 

        guarantees that evangelism will result in genuine conversions. God is 

        sure to bless His Word to the hearts of the elect into salvation. (Ephesians 

        1:11; Romans 9:11, 13, 16, 18; 2 Timothy 1:9; Acts 13:48; Romans 8:29-30; 

        Romans 10:17; 2 Thessalonians 2:13-14).</p>

      <p>From Holy Scripture we unalterably affirm that in the Presbyterian system 

        of church government the church is not merely a superintendent but an 

        agent of mission work. &quot;We wish to develop the idea that the congregation 

        of believers, as visibly organized, is the very society or corporation 

        which is divinely called to do the work of the Lord. From the session 

        to the General Assembly we shall strive to enlist all of our courts, as 

        courts, in this Christian effort of mission work in the United States. 

        We are not ashamed to confess that we are intensely Presbyterian. We embrace 

        all other denominations in the arms of Christian fellowship and love, 

        but our own scheme of government we humbly believe to be according to 

        the pattern shown in the Scripture, and by God's grace, we propose to 

        put its efficiency to the test.&quot; (Acts 15; 11:30, 14:24, 20:17, Philippians 

        1:1; 1 Timothy 3:1; 2 Timothy 4:14; Titus 1:5, 7).</p>

      <p>From Holy Scripture we resolutely affirm our desire that this part of 

        the body of Christ and its Committee on Mission to the United States be 

        zealous in evangelism, vigorous in developing churches in areas where 

        there is no Reformed witness, enthusiastic in the spread of the gospel 

        in specialized fields, earnest in training our constituency to do the 

        work of evangelism, eager in being faithful witnesses for Jesus Christ 

        to the end that God be glorified.</p>

      <p>The Second General Assembly of the National Presbyterian Church, subsequently 

        named the Presbyterian Church in America, adopted position papers proposed 

        by two of its Committees, which restate the position of the Church on 

        the mission of the Church. Again, we may find this repetitive of some 

        of the language of the &quot;<a href="../../documents/message.html">Message 

          to All Churches</a>&quot;, but it is significant that these Committees 

        were seeking to apply those principles of the &quot;Message&quot; to themselves.</p></td>
