                      <td><blockquote>&quot;The question of the wisdom of leaving judicial 
                        cases to be decided by such changeable bodies as Synods and Assemblies 
                        has long been a mooted one. In 1849 a committee was appointed on the subject, 
                        and it worked out an elaborate plan for a Permanent -Judicial Commission. 
                        Presbyteries, Synods and General Assemblies are very changeable bodies, 
                        because the elders are usually appointed to attend but a single meeting. 
                        Even the ministers, however able and scholarly they may be in general, 
                        are not specially trained and habituated to the work of analyzing testimony 
                        and excluding irrelevant matter. With a view, therefore, to securing picked 
                        men to decide these intricate cases, it was proposed that there should 
                        be in each Synod and for the General Assembly a commission of appeals, 
                        composed of four ministers and four elders, elected two each year. The 
                        plan, however, was almost unanimously rejected. The discussion developed 
                        widespread feeling, first that the time of the General Assembly and the 
                        subordinate judicatories should not be occupied with many judicial cases 
                        to the exclusion of or interference with church mission work; and second, 
                        that some method should be devised for a more careful consideration of 
                        each case by selection persons qualified to decide its vital points on 
                        their real merits...&quot; <br />
                        &quot;One great burden long felt by the General Assembly 
                        was the careful and sufficient trial of judicial cases. Sometimes methods 
                        of relief have been adopted that could scarcely be defended in accordance 
                        with the strict construction of the Form of Government. A somewhat inexperienced 
                        member of the Judicial Committee of a certain General Assembly asked the 
                        chairman of his committee what the duties of the committee were. The chairman 
                        replied, with more regard to facts than to the constitution: `The business 
                        of our committee is to find some way to save the General Assembly from 
                        wasting time on judicial cases.' This need of relieving the General Assembly 
                        from the burden of judicial business was one strong reason which led the 
                        church, about 1880, to amend the Form of Government, so that the decisions 
                        of Synods should be final in all cases not involving doctrine or government....&quot; <br />
                        &quot;From the earliest history of Presbyterianism it has been recognized as 
                        the right of the General Assembly or a Synod to appoint a Commission clothed 
                        with the power of Synod to discharge certain duties.... The early Synod 
                        appointed an annual Commission, and theoretically clothed that Commission 
                        with the whole power of the Synod. This made the Commission somewhat like 
                        the Synod sitting the whole year, and adjourning from time to time as 
                        business might require. It was not therefore a new suggestion that `Judicial 
                        Commissions' might be appointed. It was simply an adaptation of a principle 
                        of church government always previously recognized, that it might now be 
                        applied to a more careful trying of judicial cases. In 1879, therefore, 
                        an overture was sent down from the General Assembly to the Presbyteries 
                        for such an amendment to the Constitution as would authorize the appointment 
                        of a special Judicial Commission for each case. The decision of such a 
                        Commission is to be reported to the body that appointed it. This has been 
                        found to be a good solution of the question of time. It is a good solution 
                        also, as to the question of securing suitable persons to try appeal cases. 
                        Many a minister or prudent elder may be an excellent speaker and a very 
                        pious man without being at the same time an ecclesiastical judge, and 
                        a persons competent to sift evidence and measure its weight. These Judicial 
                        Commissions are appointed for the purpose of having the most suitable 
                        men to try each case. Most commonly these Judicial Commissions are in 
                        fact Commissions of Arbitration, as their members are agreed upon by the 
                        parties to the case. The decision of the Commission is reported to the 
                        appointing body, and entered on its records. The proposition for a permanent 
                        Judicial Commission has been presented to, discussed and dismissed without 
                        action in the Old School Assemblies of 1849, 1854 and 1855. It was up 
                        again in 1866, and this time an overture on the subject was sent down 
                        to the Presbyteries and defeated in them. These discussions prepared the 
                        Church for this step of special Judicial Commission as a good mode of 
                        procedure for the higher Church Judicatories in appeal cases.&quot; </blockquote></td>

                    any ecclesiastical judicatory to appoint a Commission, to determine judicially 
                    any case whatever.&quot; The Report opposed the resolution, arguing that the 
                    practice is contrary to neither and concluded, &quot;In view therefore, of 
                    the original rights of our judicatories, of the longcontinued practice 
                    of the Church, and of the great value of the right, on due occasions, 
                    of acting by Commissions, the hope is respectfully expressed, that the 
                    Assembly may do nothing, which may have the effect of calling that right 
                    in question.&quot; The final disposition was the indefinite postponement of

                    the right to a seat, clothed with full power of the court itself.&quot; . <br />

                    In response to discussion at the 1854 GA concerning judicial commissions, 
                    Hodge provides an insightful discussion of the fundamental nature of Presbyterian 
                    courts, their powers, and their relation to the constitution of the Church. 
                    With respect to commissions H. takes a view similar to Thornwell, <em>infra</em>, 
                    and contrary to Baird, <em>supra</em>. Concludes by briefly answering objections 
                    to judicial commissions. <br />

  &quot;This is another lesson 
                    [portions of six days of an Assembly spent on one case] teaching what 
                    the Church seems slow to learn; that a body consisting of upwards of two 
                    hundred members is not a very suitable court of appeal.... We believe 
                    the necessity for the appointment of a commission is forcing itself more

                    judicatories are sometimes so oppressed with judicial business, that it 
                    might be well, on some occasions, to resort to this old usage of our church....

  &quot;After studying 
                    closely fifty judicial cases coming up to the General Assembly, from 1870 
                    to 1909, and having had all judicial cases since then go through my hands 
                    as clerk, I do not find a single case in which the Assembly opened for 
                    discussion the judgment of a commission to which an appeal or complaint 
                    was given. In very case, the judgment of the commission was entered on 
                    the minutes as the judgment of the Assembly. In 1889, I was a commissioner 
                    to the General Assembly, and saw an effort made by the defense counsel 
                    to have the case opened for further discussion after the commission had 
                    made its report. The moderator decided against this being done. Rev. G.D. 
                    Armstrong, D.D., was chairman of the commission. He had been the chairman 
                    of a committee of the Assembly that revised our old Book of Church Order 
                    and prepared the articles on Ecclesiastical Commissions, He explained 
                    to the Assembly the meaning of these articles, in which he stated very 
                    clearly that it was not the intention of the Book of Church Order to indicate 
                    that the case would be opened in the court for further consideration after 
                    the commission had made its report, but its judgment should be entered 
                    upon the records of the court as the judgment of the court itself In this 
                    case, this was done, and the judgment of the commission became the judgment 
                    of the Assembly.&quot; <br />

                    one the chief theoreticians of church polity among Old School Theologians. 
                    &quot;[O]ne thing is perfectly obvious, namely, that as discipline is now administered 
                    in our superior church Courts ... it amounts either to a denial or a perversion 
                    of justice.... And this state of things is getting worse and worse-until 
                    the whole thing is becoming a scoffing to the wicked, and a deadly heartsore 
                    to good men.... We would undertake to screen any offender before the General 
                    Assembly more certainly than before any jury of twelve upright men.... 
                    We confess ourselves to be averse even to the appearance of stripping 
                    the church courts of the exercise of any power vested in any of them by 
                    the Lord.... We therefore greatly prefer to reduce the church courts, 
                    all of them, to denominations [numbers of delegates] in which they will 
                    be masters of their time and business, and every member feel his proper 
                    responsibility; rather than keep them at an unwieldy size, [<strong>Note</strong>: Robinson thought there should be no more than 
                    100 commissioners.] and appoint 
                    commissions to do any part of their work.... We say we prefer this method 
                    of dealing with the subject-by far to any other, and think we could show 
                    abundant reason for that preference. * * * As to the power of the church 
                    courts, however, to appoint commissions, that power is just as clear as 
                    their power to appoint committees; and it has been as invariably exercised.... 
                    [A]nd with all due respect.... it is simply ridiculous to deny the existence 
                    of the power in the Assembly.... [W]hat utter folly is it, to pretend 
                    that it has no power, and ought not to have any, to appoint a similar 
                    body to ascertain and determine, whether a certain Minister got drunk, 
                    or a certain Elder is dishonest.... [W]e violate all laws human and divine, 
                    by pretending to try them before two or three hundred Presbyters, when 
                    in fact, by that pretence, they are prevented from being tried at all.... 
                    sending them before tribunals which ... are utterly indisposed, and hopelessly 
                    incompetent to administer justice. *** [O]f all parts of the duty of the 
                    General Assembly, the one to which the use of a commission is most peculiarly 
                    appropriate, [is to try cases of discipline].... [N]o sane man, who had 
                    a just cause, but would prefer that any ten, of three hundred respectable 
                    gentlemen, should try his cause-rather than let the whole three hundred 
                    try it.... The sole object of the existence of that General Assembly is 
                    to do God's work in the world; one of the most thoroughly important portions 
                    of which is the righteous administration of discipline. This part of its 
                    work the Assembly grossly neglects, and is no longer competent to perform 
                    aright, by reasons of its enormous bulk, the vast accumulation of its 
                    business, and the necessary shortness of its sessions. The conclusion 
                    is irresistible. And they who oppose and defeat some adequate reform, 
                    are to be held justly to a rigorous account for all the evils that may 
                    follow.&quot; (pp. 348-50) 61<br />

                    Can the Assembly answer questions in &quot;thesi&quot;? It does not 
                    appear that the constitution ever designed that the General Assembly should 
                    ever take up abstract cases and decide on them, especially when the object 
                    appears to be to bring these decisions to bear on particular individuals 
                    no judicially before the Assembly.&quot; [citing <em>Presbyterian Digest</em>, p. 279.] 
                    What authority have the decisions of the Assembly? Even its recommendations 
                    are of authority, coming as they do from a body representing the whole 
                    Church. Its recommendations concerning the Boards are obligatory. Its 
                    replies to overtures are authoritative interpretations of the constitution. 
                    Its testimony on doctrine and morality is the Church's declaration of 
                    the meaning of the &quot;Confession of Faith,&quot; and its application. <u>And its 
                      judicial decisions are final and obligatory in all similar cases</u>.&quot; No

                    Deliverances and General Assembly decisions. Two 
                    forms of decisions: 1. The General Assembly sits as a deliberative body 
                    which is legislative. 2. The General Assembly frequently sits as a court, 
                    in the trial of judicial cases.... 1. <u>The deliverance that is of the highest 
                      authority is that of a decision in a judicial case</u>, the case having 
                    come up by appeal or complaint from the lower court. The General Assembly 
                    sits as the supreme court of Jesus Christ, and its decision is final. 
                    It determines and concludes a particular case. (see also paragraph 418.) 
                    The Assembly in 1879 made a deliverance stating that the deliverances 
                    of 1865, 1869 and 1877 on the subject of worldly amusements are not to 
                    be accepted and enforced as law by judicial process upon the following 
                    grounds: <strong><br />
                      (1)</strong> That these deliverances do not require judicial prosecution 
                    expressly, and could not require it without violating the spirit of our 
                    law. <strong><br />
                      (2)</strong> that none of these deliverances were made by the Assembly in 
                    a strictly judicial capacity, <u>but were all deliverances <em>in thesi</em>, and 
                      therefore can be considered as only didactic, advisory and monitory</u>. [p. 
                    183; <strong>Note</strong> that this phrase, &quot;didactic, advisory 
                    and monitory&quot; applies only to <em>in thesi</em> statements, not judicial decisions.&quot;]&quot; <strong><br />
                      (3)</strong> That the Assembly has no power to issue orders to institute 
                    process except according to the provisions of the Rules of Discipline 
                    found in the Book of Church Order (revised 1925).&quot; (A.D. 1910; M.G.A. 
                    1879, p. 23.).... <br />
                    Force of <em>in thesi</em> deliverance. A judicial sentence cannot 
                    be set aside by an in thesi deliverance. While it is competent for one 
                    General Assembly, under the rules provided by the constitution, to grant 
                    a new hearing to a case which has been judicially decided by a previous 
                    Assembly, a deliverance by the Assembly could not modify or set aside 
                    the judicial sentence. (A.D. 1922, p. 166, 167; M.G.A. 1879, p. 57.) (Also 
                    see par. 416.) [p. 185].... Original jurisdiction in judicial cases. The 
                    General Assembly has no original jurisdiction in matters of discipline; 
                    but when a judicial case comes before the Assembly, by appeal or complaint, 
                    it has the power to declare the law in this particular case. <u>This judicial 
                      interpretation of the law is the interpretation in connection with a given 
                      case. This decision becomes the law of the Church in cases similar to 
                      this given case. Decisions of this kind are not to be construed as in 
                      thesi deliverances, but are of biding authorit</u>y. These decisions have 
                    been made after the matter has been discussed in two or more courts and 
                    after everything connected with it has been discussed freely, not only 
                    in the lower court but also in the Assembly. [p. 188]. (Emphasis added.) <br />

                    There is no doubt that there is 
                    an area of tolerated divergence from the Confession of Faith. How large 
                    that area is will depend upon the degree of readiness there may be in 
                    the Church to move the ecclesiastical courts, and upon the decisions reached 
                    in the court of last resort. Historical students may tell us what the 
                    Church has thought upon the subject, and dogmatic theologians may tell 
                    us what the Church ought to think; but it is <u>only as the General Assembly 
                      decides concrete cases in appellate jurisdiction, and the principle of 
                      stare decisis may be supposed to govern subsequent deliverances, that 
                      the area of tolerated divergence can be defined</u>. (Emphasis added)<br />

                        <p>&quot;The principle here involved is 
                          one of immense importance. It lies at the root of all the struggles between 
                          the advocates of a constitutional government and the advocates of an `absolutism.' 
                          The forms of constitutional government and of absolutism, both in church 
                          and in state, have varied indefinitely; but the essence of the struggle 
                          has always been the same. Abstracted from its accidental forms, the question 
                          has always been, whether the power of the whole is over every part, or 
                          only over the power of the part....&quot; [335-336.] <br />

                          &quot;[W]e must repeat the 
                          `state of the question' once more: Does the same force belong to the deliverances <em>in thesi </em>of the higher courts as to their judicial decisions? Do the two 
                          classes of decisions regulate and determine the administration of discipline 
                          in the same way and to the same extent? Or, to express the same thing 
                          in other words, does the interpretation of a law by an appellate court&#8212;the 
                          interpretation being given <em>in thesis</em>&#8212;bind a court of original jurisdiction 
                          in such as sense as to deprive it of its power of judgment as to the meaning 
                          of said law, and compel it to accept and act upon the interpretation of 
                          the appellate court as the law of the Church? ... The General Assembly 
                          of 1879 answers it clearly and unanimously in the <em>negative</em>; and, we think, 
                          truly and righteously....&quot; [pp. 337-338.] <br />
                          <br />
                          &quot;We confess to a great astonishment 
                          that brethren should insist that deliverances <em>in thesi</em> have the same force 
                          and judicial decisions. The two classes of acts are reached by processes 
                          wholly different. A deliverance in thesi may concern a subject which has 
                          never been before the church or any of its courts; may be `sprung' upon 
                          the Assembly by some ardent and eloquent member, and be carried by his 
                          personal influence and eloquence. A judicial decision by that court necessarily 
                          implies discussion in a least two of the lower courts-in a cause originating 
                          in the session it is implied that the matter has been discussed in <em>three</em>&#8212;before 
                          it is called to decide. The cause is represented on both sides by counsel, 
                          who are fully heard; and the members of the court next below are heard, 
                          etc., etc.; all circumstances which give assurance that the matter has 
                          been fully discussed by those most competent to do it. Further, the deliverance <em>in thesi</em> is apt to be sweeping and general. <u>The judicial 
                            decision is upon a case, is interpreted by it, and is applicable only

                          case will be more sensibly felt by the members of the court, because they 
                          are not only interpreting the law, but are judging a brother, and are 
                          determining his ecclesiastical status....&quot; [pp. 344-345.] <br />

                          of the unity of the church is to be realized on any larger scale than 
                          that of a single <em>coetus fidelium</em>, there must be appellate jurisdiction, 
                          and a power given to some higher court to `<em>decide</em>' all controversies. 
                          This is the reason why <u>a `judicial decision' of the General Assembly becomes 
                            law and continues to be law until a contrary decision is rendered by the 
                            same court-law, in the sense of a regulator of the exercise of discipline 
                            in the courts below.... [T]he courts of original jurisdiction have the 
                            right to interpret the law for themselves, until a judicial decision of 
                            the highest court shall decide the matter.</u>&quot; [p. 346, 348.] (Emphasis added)</p>

                    This is a power peculiar to the Assembly; for, while 
                    the other courts decide in the sense of rendering a judgment, that judgment, 
                    if controverted, is not the DECISION of the controversy; but the Assembly's 
                    judgment is the judgment of the Church, and is, therefore, the end of 
                    the controversy. When, then, the Assembly has decided, is that a prohibition 
                    of further discussion? By no means. But <u>the Assembly's decision in a controversy 
                      respecting doctrine is thenceforth the doctrine of the Church</u>; and further 
                    opposition to this doctrine is opposition to the doctrine of the Church, 
                    and is permissible only within the limitations within which opposition 
                    to the doctrine of the Church is permissible. And the decision of the 
                    Assembly in a controversy respecting discipline fixes the status of the 
                    parties affected, and they <u>are to be treated accordingly in their ecclesiastical 
                      relations by all who prefer to remain in this Church and free from its 
                  censure</u>. (Emphasis added)</p></td>
