        <strong>Summary</strong>: Alleged MVP erred by ordaining a man holding certain views on &quot;tongues&quot; &amp; &quot;prophecy.&quot; <br />

        SJC's  recommended judgment against sustaining was not approved by 25th GA (vote 229-423). <br />

        Special Commission  of 10 TEs and 10 REs was then appointed by moderator to re-hear, and it reported the decision below in 1998.<br />

        <strong>Statement of the Issues:</strong><br />

        1. Did MVP err in approving TE Blaha's theological examination in relation to his view of tongues?<br />

        2. Did MVP err in approving TE Blaha's theological examination in relation to his view of prophecy?<br />

        3. Did MVP err in not holding that TE Blaha's views violate <em>BCO</em> 7-1?<br />

        <strong>The Judgment</strong>:<br />

        1. No. TE Blaha's view and practice of tongues (as private prayer language) are within the bounds of the 1974  Pastoral Letter adopted by the 2nd General Assembly.<br />

        2. Yes. Based on TE Blaha's particular view of prophecy as recorded in Record of the Case, the MVP erred in 

        approving his theological examination without exception (<em>WCF</em> 1.1 and 6).<br />

        3. This issue is not within the purview of this Commission. First, the Record of the Case does not provide  sufficient argumentation on this issue. 

        Second, we recognize that in the PCA there are and have been different  interpretations of <em>BCO</em> 7-1 with regard to cessation of certain spiritual gifts. 

        Unless or until there is an allencompassing  statement by a General Assembly, we believe that the decisions of previous General Assemblies,  including judicial cases and the 1974 Pastoral Letter, provide adequate guidelines in this area (<em>BCO</em> 14-7). </span></div></td>

        <strong>Summary: </strong> TE alleged he was convicted and deposed w/o proper process.<br />

        <strong>Issue</strong>:  Did Rocky Mountain Presbytery err in receiving and immediately acting upon a motion to cite Rev.  Bruce Nickoley

        defend himself under the due process provisions for a trial as outlined in the BCO?<br />

        <strong>Judgment:</strong> Yes. This case is remanded to Presbytery with the recommendation that it either (a) institute a  prosecution against 

        Rev. Nickoley as a case under process on the charge of contumacy and/or other charges  under the due process provisions 

        of the BCO for a trial, beginning with BCO 32-3. Or (b) revoke the judgment  of deposition from the ministry against

        <strong>Summary:</strong> Deacon alleged Session erred in trial procedures on charges of his having falsely accused the Session. <br />

        (He was 

        excommunicated.) Presbytery judged his appeal out of order. SJC sustained appeal and remanded for hearing.<br />

        <strong>Issues</strong>:<br />

        1. Did Presbytery hurry to a decision before reviewing all of the evidence in the case, or before all the  testimony was taken, or without affording the accused the opportunity to meet with his accusers and defend  himself?<br />

        2. Did the Session hurry to a decision before reviewing all of the evidence in the case, or before all the  testimony was taken, or without affording the accused the opportunity to meet with his accusers and defend  himself?<br />

        3. Did the Session refuse to set a date and time when appellant could be present at trial, and if so, did it violate  appellant's rights under BCO 42-3?<br />

        4. Was the Session manifestly prejudiced?<br />

        5. Did the Session err by inflicting upon appellant the harshest censure of excommunication under the record of  this case?<br />

        <strong>Judgment:</strong><br />

        1. Presbytery erred (a) in failing to notify the appellant of the time, date and place for hearing the appeal and (b)  in failing to adjudicate the appeal, once the appeal was found to be in order. This case is remanded to Evangel  Presbytery under BCO 42-9.<br />

        2. We make no ruling as to Issues 2, 3, 4 and 5, which are properly the subject of the disposition of this case by  Evangel Presbytery on remand.<br />

        <strong>Summary:  </strong>Alleged 5 errors. SJC sustained on one, ruling S erred by excommunicating instead of imposing a  lesser censure. Remanded for imposition of indef susp from sacraments.<br />

        <strong>Issue:</strong><br />

        1. Was it reversible error, under these particular circumstances, for the Session of Christ Covenant Church to  have instituted judicial process against Dr. Shive prior to allowing personal contact between Dr. Shive and the  ladies against whom he sinned in an effort to seek the reconciliation of these parties?<br />

        2. Did the Session of Christ Covenant Church commit reversible error in not recusing several members of the  court who had stated an opinion concerning the case and was there a reversible prejudice present in this case?<br />

        3. Was it reversible error, under these particular circumstances, for the prosecutor of the charges filed against  Dr. Shive, who was also a member of the court, to be involved in the court's deliberations?<br />

        4. Were there procedural and substantive errors committed by Central Carolina Presbytery in this case which  require a remand in this case?<br />

        5. Did Central Carolina Presbytery err by affirming the decision of Christ Covenant Church Session's infliction  upon Dr. Robert M. Shive the highest censure based on the Record of the Case?<br />

        <strong>Judgment:</strong><br />

        1. No. The Session acted under its authority of BCO 31-7 when it instituted the judicial process without  allowing a personal meeting between Dr. Shive and the ladies against whom he committed sin.<br />

        2. No. The record does not reflect that the actions mandating recusal under BCO 32-17 occurred. Furthermore,  two of the three members of the court complained of by Dr. Shive voluntarily recused themselves from the  court prior to the court's final deliberations as to the judgment and censure to be imposed.<br />

        3. No. While we believe it was an error of judgment and an error of application of BCO 31-7, especially in light  of BCO 32-19, for the prosecutor to have been a part of the court during its deliberations, we do not believe that  this error requires a reversal of the judgment and a remand for a new trial in this particular case.<br />

        4. No. We do not find that errors were committed by Central Carolina Presbytery requiring reversal and remand.<br />

        5. Yes. Central Carolina Presbytery erred in affirming, and the Session of Christ Covenant Church erred in  going straight to, the highest censure of excommunication in light of the lack of compelling evidence in the  Record of the Case to reflect that Dr. Shive is contumacious or impenitent. See BCO 30-4 and 33-3. Pursuant to  BCO 42-9, we reverse that portion of the judgment by the Session of Christ Covenant Church inflicting the  censure of excommunication on Dr. Shive, and we remand the matter back to the Session of Christ Covenant  Church for it to impose the censure of indefinite suspension from the Sacraments upon Dr. Robert M. Shive in  accordance with BCO 36-5, and with the instruction that, until satisfactory evidence of repentance is given to  the Session of Christ Covenant Church, to impose such conditions concerning Dr. Shive's involvement in the  life of Christ Covenant Church as the Session may find.<br />

time, the GA, without debate, approved or disapproved all SJC decisions.) The following year the SJC reported its investigation to the 29th GA in Dallas and its decision declining to indict due to lack of a strong presumption 

of guilt. Dallas GA approved that decision.<br />

      <strong>Summary:</strong> Alleged S erred by (1) misinterpreting a previous SJC Decision [1997-09] and (2) by increasing<br />

censure from indefinite susp from sacraments to excommunication.<br />

<strong>Issues:</strong><br />

1. Did P err by affirming the S interpretation of the Judgment of SJC Case 1997-09 (Shive v. CCP) that the<br />

guilt of Dr. Shive was not reversed but affirmed as to the 4 charges of (1) sexual immorality, abuse and<br />

licentiousness (2) premeditated sexual exploitation, (3) lying and bearing false witness, and (4) scandalous<br />

living?<br />

2. Did P err by affirming the S decision to increase Dr. Shive's censure from indefinite suspension to<br />

excommunication?<br />

<strong>Judgment:</strong><br />

1. No. There is no mention in the Judgment in Case 1997-09 (26th GA Min. p. 137) that the guilt of Dr. Shive<br />

was reversed on any charge. Thus the guilty verdict of Christ Covenant Session stands unchanged on all 4<br />

charges. The penalty of excommunication was recommended to be changed to indefinite suspension from the<br />

sacraments. Hence the guilty verdict of the S in SJC Case 1997-09 remained unchanged.<br />

2. No. The Judgment in SJC Case 1997-09 gave the S these instructions:<br />
&quot;... that until satisfactory evidence of repentance is given to Session of Christ Covenant Church, to impose such conditions concerning Dr. Shive's involvement in the life of Christ Covenant Church, as the Session may find.&quot;<br />

Thus P did not err in affirming the action of the S in imposing the censure of excommunication on Dr. Shive<br />

after the S determined that Dr. Shive had not given &quot;satisfactory evidence of repentance.&quot; P properly followed<br />

BCO 39-3(2) in giving &quot;great deference to a lower court regarding these factual findings which the lower court 

is more competent to determine.&quot; We do likewise.</span></td>

<strong>Issues:</strong><br />

1. At its October 1999 meeting, by failing to either sustain or deny TE Black's complaint, did P fail to consider<br />

his complaint?<br />

2. Did P err in July 1999 when it ruled that licentiate Inman had &quot;not taken an exception to the Westminster<br />

Confession of Faith and Catechism regarding creation&quot; in light of the specific written views contained in the<br />

Record of the Case?<br />

<strong>Judgment:</strong><br />

1. No. Presbytery did not fail to consider the complaint. While the complaint was not explicitly denied, it was<br />

essentially denied and therefore the Complainant had proper right to complain to this higher/broader court. It should not be remanded simply because of the Presbytery's failure to either sustain or deny.<br />

2. No. P did not err when it ruled in July 1999 that the licentiate's view on the length of the creation days did<br />

not constitute an exception to the Westminster Standards.<br />

<strong>Issue:</strong> Did P err in its action of October 9, 2000 &quot;... to suspend the functions of the Korean Presbyterian<br />

Church of Washington Session and have the Presbytery (commission) replace the functions&quot; (of the KPCW<br />

Session) without the prior consent of the congregation?<br />

<strong>Judgment:</strong> Yes. Therefore, the subsequent actions of the Commission acting as Session of KPCW are<br />

annulled.<br />

        <strong>Summary:</strong> After being indefinitely suspended from office for 3 years, a TE alleged P erred by increasing his<br />

censure to deposition.<br />

<strong>Issues:</strong><br />

1. Did the Presbytery of North Florida err constitutionally or procedurally when it acted on January 12, 2001 to depose Anthony Dallison from the office of Teaching Elder, and to suspend him from the sacraments of the<br />

Church without instituting fresh process against him?<br />

2. Did the Presbytery of North Florida err when on January 12, 2001 it determined Anthony Dallison to be<br />

impenitent with respect to his originally confessed sin, and increased the original censure to that of deposing<br />

him from the office of Teaching Elder, and suspending him from the sacraments of the Church?<br />

<strong>Judgment:</strong><br />

1. No. Where a Teaching Elder has confessed guilt to presbytery under BCO 38-1, Presbytery has the authority to impose the censure here imposed on January 12, 2001 without initiating new charges and conducting a new 

trial.<br />

2. No. Presbytery's determination of impenitence and the imposition of additional censure based upon that<br />

determination were within the sound discretion of presbytery, and within Presbytery's authority, under BCO 37-3, 37-4, 37-8, and 34-4b.</td>

      <strong>Summary:</strong> Lease dispute between church and school (separate corporations). P acted as Arbitrator in a legally binding arbitration.<br />

      <strong>Reasoning:</strong> &quot;The SJC does not have jurisdiction in this case... While we applaud Presbytery's desire to assist<br />

two Christian parties in a dispute, PCA courts should not serve as civil arbitrators, even if both parties are under the jurisdiction of the PCA. Evangel Presbytery should not have accepted that role in the first place. Since it is 

not within the jurisdiction of a church court to serve as a civil arbitrator, then it is not within the purview of the 

SJC or the Presbytery to conduct appellate review of legally binding arbitration judgments either. In resolving 

disputes, church courts should only function in the role assigned by Scripture - as &quot;ecclesiastical arbitrators&quot; (1 

Cor. 6, Exodus 18:21-22, Matthew 18, etc.). However, in such a role, the decisions of the church have no civil 

effect. And if the parties disagree with the decision, they may ask the broader/higher church courts to review it 

via the complaint process of BCO 43.&quot;<br /></td>

<strong>Summary:</strong> Presbytery sustained deacon Jeansonne's appeal, but the Prosecutor complained. P sustained<br />

prosecutor's complaint (thus voiding its decision on the appeal.) C alleged this reversal was procedural error<br />

and claimed the sustaining of the appeal should be reinstated.<br />

<strong>Issue:</strong> Did P err in sustaining the complaint of RE Keith Williams at its July 21, 2001 stated meeting, which<br />

had the effect of rescinding its judgment of April 21, 2001 to wit: reversing in whole the judgment of the<br />

Christ Presbyterian Church Session against Deacon Neil Jeansonne?<br />

<strong>Judgment:</strong> Yes. The judgment of Eastern Carolina Presbytery of July 21, 2001 is reversed and the judgment of<br />

April 21, 2001 stands [sustaining the appeal] and thereby the case is remanded to the Session of Christ<br />

Presbyterian Church [for a new hearing or withdrawal of the charges].<br />

<strong>Reasoning excerpt:</strong> This case deals with the judicial propriety of a presbytery hearing and acting on a<br />

complaint where an appeal was taken... BCO 43-1 prohibits a complaint in a judicial case where an appeal &quot;is<br />

taken.&quot; The words, &quot;is taken,&quot; have reference to an appeal on a case whether past, current or pending. It does<br />

not mean just a current case under appeal. Once an appeal has been taken in a judicial case, no complaint is<br />

allowable.</td>

      </strong>M33GA, 2005, pages 72, 98, 146. Sustained parts 13-3. C-Op 2. Obj p. 146<br />

      <strong>Summary:</strong> Three judicial cases arose out of conflicts between the Session and congregation regarding a<br />

minister. There were 17 separate complaints rolled into these three cases. Cases 2002-02 and 2002-03 were<br />

answered by reference to the SJC decision in this case. This complaint alleged P erred by not dissolving a<br />

pastor's call after the congregation voted 52-42% to dissolve (with 5% abstaining). Presbytery declined to do<br />

because it deemed the congregation's &quot;reasons... were insufficient&quot; (BCO 23-1). P later filed an Objection after<br />

the SJC Decision, which the GA answered by referencing the C-OP.<br />

<strong>Issue:</strong><br />

1. Were all 17 of the complaints in Judicial Cases 01-34, 02-02, and 02-03 judicially in order?<br />

2. Did James River Presbytery err, at its April 21, 2001 meeting and subsequent meetings when it declined to<br />

approve its Ministerial and Church Relations Committee's (MCRC) recommendation to grant the constitutional 

request of West End Church to dissolve the relationship between TE Robert Wilson, its pastor and West End Presbyterian Church?<br />

3. Did James River Presbytery err in approving a motion, at its July 28, 2001 presbytery meeting, to make a gift equivalent to full salary and allowances to TE R. C. Wilson for a period of 3 months, pending a refusal of West End Presbyterian Church to continue payments to him?<br />

<strong>Judgment:</strong><br />

1. No. Not all 17 complaints within Judicial Cases 2001-34, 2002-02 and 2002-03 were judicially in order. The<br />

following complaints were not judicially in order, to-wit: Complaint 07-01, Judicial Case 2001-34; Complaint<br />

10-01, Judicial Case 2002-02; Complaint 13-01, Judicial Case 2002-02; Unnumbered Complaint - Judicial Case<br />

2002-02; Complaint 16-01, Judicial Case 2002-03; Complaint 18-01, Judicial Case 2002-03; Complaint 19-01,<br />

Judicial Case 2002-03. All the other complaints in these cases were in order.<br />

2. Yes. James River Presbytery had no constitutional basis at its Presbytery meetings in 2001beginning with its April 21, 2001 meeting, permitting it to delay granting a proper constitutional request by West End Presbyterian Church to dissolve the relationship between the local church and its pastor.<br />

3. No. This gift was within the discretion of James River Presbytery to determine its own benevolent giving.</td>

      <strong>Summary: </strong>Alleged P erred by not hearing appeal. (See also 2004-02.)<br />

<strong>Issues:</strong><br />

1. Did Philadelphia Presbytery err in its interpretation of BCO 42-2 and as a result did not accept Mrs.<br />

Plowman's Appeal dated July 31, 2002 against the judgment of the Session of Lehigh Valley Presbyterian<br />

<strong>Judgment:</strong><br />

1. Yes. The case is remanded to Philadelphia Presbytery to hear the Appeal as originally filed on July 31, 2002.<br />

2. Yes. BCO 43-1 states that a Complaint cannot be filed where an Appeal is pending. There was an Appeal<br />

      <strong>Summary: </strong>Two REs filed charges against their pastor (Abshire). Two members of the congregation then filed<br />

charges against those two REs. The pastor and other RE on Session administratively suspended the two REs<br />

from office. P formed a judicial commission to look into the matter and it eventually annulled the suspensions 

and dismissed the charges against the two REs. TE Abshire complained against the commission's actions, alleging the P Commission failed to follow BCO 43 in handling complaint from two REs who were suspended from office.<br />

<strong>Issue:</strong><br />

1. Did Presbytery err by appointing a Judicial Commission prematurely?<br />

2. Did the Commission exceed its authority as granted by the charge of the Presbytery?<br />

<strong>Judgment:</strong><br />

<strong>Judgment:</strong><br />

1. Yes. The matter is remanded back to P for a new hearing with the instruction that P is to conduct a new BCO 31-2 investigation of the secret taping of TE Smith. The P investigation needs to pursue the testimony of<br />

      <strong>Summary:</strong> Alleged S had manifestation of prejudice in various aspects of the judicial process. Alleged S erred<br />

by stopping a trial and convicting her of contumacy for refusing to have her 14 and 16 yr. old children testify in a trial related to marital separation. See also 2002-05.<br />

<strong>Issues:</strong><br />

1. Did the Presbytery err in ruling that the trial of Mrs. Plowman may be resumed by the Session of Lehigh<br />

Valley Presbyterian Church with a new TE moderator chosen by the Session (Summary of The Facts 12.d)?<br />

2. Did the P err in not lifting all the suspensions of Mrs. Plowman from the Lord's Table?<br />

3. Did P err in finding no manifestation of prejudice by the Session of LVPC in the handling of this case?<br />

<strong>Judgment:</strong><br />

1. Yes<br />

2. Yes<br />

3. Yes. Therefore the appeal is sustained and all judgments and censures are set aside.<br />

<strong>Issue:</strong><br />
 1. Did Heritage Presbytery err when it ruled, &quot;There is nothing either implicit or explicit in the BCO stating that changes in a pastor's call be approved by vote of the congregation&quot;? (Record of the Case, p. 17)<br />

action of May 30, 2003 denying Mrs. Clark's April 24, 2003 request for the removal of her censures and a<br />

      <strong>Summary: </strong> Alleged P erred when it sustained a C alleging, (1) S erred by adding items to docket of<br />

congregational meeting and (2) S erred by recommending a course of action to congregation.<br />

<strong>Issues:</strong><br />

1. Did the P err in rejecting the Session's right to add items to the agenda of a congregational meeting called in response to a petition from members of the congregation [BCO 25-2]?<br />

2. Did the P err in rejecting the Session's right to inform the members of the congregation of the rights afforded to them by BCO 24-6 and to recommend that the members of the congregation exercise those rights; and then in 

annulling the subsequent actions of the Session as indicated in Statement of the Facts 7:c and d?<br />

<strong>Judgment:</strong><br />

1. Yes. BCO 25-2 does not prohibit a S from adding additional agenda items to a congregational meeting<br />

conducted pursuant to a petition from the congregation, and as announced in the call for the meeting.<br />

2. Yes. BCO 24-6 does not prohibit a S from placing a congregation's right to seek dissolution of its official<br />

relationship with certain ruling elders before the congregation through a recommended course of action, nor to take subsequent action based on that vote.<br />
